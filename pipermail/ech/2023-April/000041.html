<PRE>Our testing strategy is that we have a separate TLS stack for this sort of
thing.

Where possible, I prefer to avoid littering the security-critical,
production implementation with options that are always invalid, just needed
for testing.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think using the most recent config is right. We started with that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in an early prototype, but quickly realized that doesn't work. For
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BoringSSL's API, when we make a config set, we just let you mark which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configs are to be sent as retry configs and which aren't. I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need a callback.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First, consider a service backed by multiple servers, as in most large
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deployments. It is impossible to atomically deploy something across all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; servers concurrently, but you also need to rotate keys, so your
</I>&gt;<i> deployment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; model needs to take all this into account. You'll need to satisfy the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; following:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - New ECHConfigs, when they're generated, do not end up in DNS until all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [or almost all] your servers support it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - DNS caches should be assumed stale, so servers also need to support the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; last few generations of keys
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - The recovery flow makes a new connection, so it may hit a new server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thus retry configs should also be ones that are expected to be supported
</I>&gt;<i> by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all servers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Put all this together and you get something of this rough shape:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Servers keep a window of N configs. The most recent or so is in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process of being rolled out and may not be available on all its peers
</I>&gt;<i> yet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then there's one config that the server believes is rolled out to all its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; peers. *That* one should be the retry config. Then it also retains N-2 or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so configs past that to deal with stale caches.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Periodically, some provisioning process generates a new ECHConfig,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prepends it to this list, retires the oldest one, and deploys the new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window to all servers. The new config is *not* put in DNS yet because not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all servers have it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Once the new config is sufficiently rolled out, put the new config in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DNS, replacing the previous config. Possibly also do a round of rollout
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all the servers to tell them they can bump the retry config forward by
</I>&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generation, though the generation before that should also work fine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provided N is large enough.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Second, there may be more than one retry config, hence why it's an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ECHConfigList. ECH's extensibility model is that the server presents
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple ECHConfigs and the client picks one. Suppose an ECH server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supports both P-256 and X25519 KEMs. It would then provision pairs of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (P-256, X25519) configs every time it rotates. So while I said N configs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; above, it's really N pairs (or more depending on what your generation
</I>&gt;<i> size
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is). The thing that goes in DNS and retry configs is one full generation
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configs. That means your API should be able to express that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Put another way: the retry config should be the answer to &quot;what would I,
</I>&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; individual server instance, want to put in DNS, as of the information I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have right now?&quot; Having a simple boolean associated with each config
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suffices to let the caller control this, which is what we've done.
</I>&gt;<i> (Though
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looking back, I see we didn't document the details here as well as I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thought we had. I'll see about fixing that...)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hiya,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I've been adding code for testing badly encoded ECH stuff
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to my branch, esp. for EncodedClientHelloInner which is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; new thing that could cause server bugs. That's in [1] and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; seems like a reasonable start to doing that well. And that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; approach (for testing) also seems to work ok for badly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; constructed values for the ECH acceptance signal in SH.random
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; or within HRRs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; One problem I've not solved (within the test harness) is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; how to do similarly for the retry-config values returned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; by a server when the wrong ECH public value is used by a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; client (or if a client GREASEs). Right now, a server (that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; has some ECH private values loaded) will return the ECHConfig
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; corresponding to the most recently loaded ECH private value,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; which I think is reasonable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; However, for testing, it might be useful to enable a server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to trigger a callback, so that it could return a borked
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; retry-config value, to check that doesn't result in badness
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; for a client.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; My question is: would it be useful for real servers to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; able to choose the retry-config value to return via a new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; callback? I guess that might be useful for servers that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; use multiple CDNs, but I'm not at all sure, since I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; get near such servers... hence asking:-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Secondary question: if useful, then what params might such
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a callback need?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Opinions welcome!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; S.
