Hi David,

Thanks for all that, which makes sense (and yet again
shows that I don't know about big servers;-). I'll look
at mimicing that approach.

One question: did you do anything that enables a server
to return a borked ECHConfigList as the retry-config for
test purposes? (I guess I can do up a special server for
that but be nicer were it possible to do such tests as
part of the openssl ``make test`` target.)

Cheers,
S.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, consider a service backed by multiple servers, as in most large

</I>&gt;<i> servers concurrently, but you also need to rotate keys, so your deployment
</I>&gt;<i> model needs to take all this into account. You'll need to satisfy the
</I>&gt;<i> following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - New ECHConfigs, when they're generated, do not end up in DNS until all
</I>&gt;<i> [or almost all] your servers support it
</I>&gt;<i> - DNS caches should be assumed stale, so servers also need to support the
</I>&gt;<i> last few generations of keys
</I>&gt;<i> - The recovery flow makes a new connection, so it may hit a new server.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus retry configs should also be ones that are expected to be supported by
</I>&gt;<i> all servers
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Put all this together and you get something of this rough shape:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Servers keep a window of N configs. The most recent or so is in the
</I>&gt;<i> process of being rolled out and may not be available on all its peers yet.
</I>&gt;<i> Then there's one config that the server believes is rolled out to all its
</I>&gt;<i> peers. *That* one should be the retry config. Then it also retains N-2 or
</I>&gt;<i> so configs past that to deal with stale caches.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Periodically, some provisioning process generates a new ECHConfig,
</I>&gt;<i> prepends it to this list, retires the oldest one, and deploys the new
</I>&gt;<i> window to all servers. The new config is *not* put in DNS yet because not
</I>&gt;<i> all servers have it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Once the new config is sufficiently rolled out, put the new config in
</I>&gt;<i> DNS, replacing the previous config. Possibly also do a round of rollout to
</I>&gt;<i> all the servers to tell them they can bump the retry config forward by one
</I>&gt;<i> generation, though the generation before that should also work fine
</I>&gt;<i> provided N is large enough.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second, there may be more than one retry config, hence why it's an
</I>&gt;<i> ECHConfigList. ECH's extensibility model is that the server presents
</I>&gt;<i> multiple ECHConfigs and the client picks one. Suppose an ECH server
</I>&gt;<i> supports both P-256 and X25519 KEMs. It would then provision pairs of
</I>&gt;<i> (P-256, X25519) configs every time it rotates. So while I said N configs
</I>&gt;<i> above, it's really N pairs (or more depending on what your generation size
</I>&gt;<i> is). The thing that goes in DNS and retry configs is one full generation of
</I>&gt;<i> configs. That means your API should be able to express that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Put another way: the retry config should be the answer to &quot;what would I, an
</I>&gt;<i> individual server instance, want to put in DNS, as of the information I
</I>&gt;<i> have right now?&quot; Having a simple boolean associated with each config
</I>&gt;<i> suffices to let the caller control this, which is what we've done. (Though
</I>&gt;<i> looking back, I see we didn't document the details here as well as I
</I>&gt;<i> thought we had. I'll see about fixing that...)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One problem I've not solved (within the test harness) is

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corresponding to the most recently loaded ECH private value,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which I think is reasonable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, for testing, it might be useful to enable a server
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to trigger a callback, so that it could return a borked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> retry-config value, to check that doesn't result in badness
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for a client.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My question is: would it be useful for real servers to be

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> callback? I guess that might be useful for servers that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use multiple CDNs, but I'm not at all sure, since I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get near such servers... hence asking:-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Secondary question: if useful, then what params might such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a callback need?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Opinions welcome!
