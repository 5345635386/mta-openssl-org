</I>&gt;<i> At the recent IETF meeting the TLS WG decided to ask IANA to do
</I>&gt;<i> an early codepoint allocation of the TLS codepoints needed for
</I>&gt;<i> ECH. That's good news as it means there should be no need for any
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;flag day&quot; due to the current deployments (whether experimental
</I>&gt;<i> or other). The TLS WG also still plan to move the draft spec to
</I>&gt;<i> last call soon, so we might have an RFC in the first few months
</I>&gt;<i> of next year.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In other news, browsers are now shipping with ECH turned on by
</I>&gt;<i> default rather than behind a flag as was previously the case.
</I>&gt;<i> (FF still needs DoH to have been used, but chrome and friends
</I>&gt;<i> seemingly don't.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I realise that the OpenSSL policy is to not merge things like
</I>&gt;<i> this until the RFC issues, (which is fine) but this PR will,
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately be fairly mega-huge, so I expect it'll take quite
</I>&gt;<i> a while to get sufficient review and make the improvements that
</I>&gt;<i> I fully expect reviewers will suggest.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given all that, my plan is to create that ECH PR in a week or
</I>&gt;<i> so, with the expectation that it'll also take some months to
</I>&gt;<i> process. But just before doing that, I reckoned it'd be worth
</I>&gt;<i> doing a bit of a rehearsal to see if there's anything else that
</I>&gt;<i> I can do to make review easier.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I've made a branch that's pretty much what I'd put in the
</I>&gt;<i> PR, with all the dev commits squashed down into 7 chunky but
</I>&gt;<i> not too large ones. The diff of that vs. the master branch is
</I>&gt;<i> at [1].
</I>&gt;<i>

Thanks for that - this will certainly make it easier to review.


&gt;<i> So, my question: what else could I do to make this easier for
</I>&gt;<i> reviewers?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Nothing else is immediately springing to mind.

Matt


&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> S.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS: Apologies for the size of this, we may be able to make it
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat smaller during processing of the PR (e.g. there's some
</I>&gt;<i> tracing code that can be dropped as we go), but I'm afraid that
</I>&gt;<i> it can't really get that much smaller, sorry;-(
