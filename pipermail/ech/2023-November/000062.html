</I>&gt;<i> The ECH branch [1] we have seems functional and hopefully the IETF spec
</I>&gt;<i> is heading towards being done. To date, there's no indication that
</I>&gt;<i> protocol changes that'd affect interop seem likely in the near
</I>&gt;<i> future and there's an announced intention to handle the official/final
</I>&gt;<i> TLS extension codepoints(*) in a way that'd be good to handle in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of making a PR soon.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, all that going well, my non-secret plan is to tidy up a few
</I>&gt;<i> things(**) and to create a PR for ECH in the coming weeks. It's fine
</I>&gt;<i> if that takes some time for the project to digest (there's a *lot*
</I>&gt;<i> of widely distributed code changes, that I can't see a good way to

</I>&gt;<i> but I figure better to get started down the processing-the-PR road
</I>&gt;<i> with the optimistic goal that the RFC issues about the time the
</I>&gt;<i> PR seems ready to merge. (Again optimistically, that'd be in early
</I>&gt;<i> 2024.)
</I>&gt;<i>

Thanks for the update Stephen.

&gt;<i> Lastly, I've so far done nothing at all to consider ECH+QUIC. (I've
</I>&gt;<i> also done nothing to try make that harder though.) If that's a thing
</I>&gt;<i> that needs chatting about now, then be great to know that, but my
</I>&gt;<i> assumption is that it's worthwhile progressing a PR for ECH+TLS/TCP
</I>&gt;<i> first, before turning attention to ECH+QUIC.
</I>
Yeah, lets not worry about ECH+QUIC just yet.

Matt

</I>&gt;<i> (*) As the drafts for ECH have evolved, we've been incrementing
</I>&gt;<i> the TLS extension codepoints to preserve interop, so the current
</I>&gt;<i> ECH TLS extension codepoint (0xfe0d), is picked from an experimental
</I>&gt;<i> range. The plan as of now, is not to change to a new codepoint for
</I>&gt;<i> the final version, but to assign the previously experimental ones
</I>&gt;<i> as the official/final codepoints. That's nice in that if it happens
</I>&gt;<i> as planned, it'll avoid the need for a flag-day or transition for
</I>&gt;<i> current code/deployments.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (**) There are a few ways in which the branch needs to be changed
</I>&gt;<i> before or during the processing of the PR, e.g., likely integrating
</I>&gt;<i> what's currently in ``include/openssl/ech.h`` into ``ssl.h`` so I'll
</I>&gt;<i> do an edit/test pass like that before creating a PR. I think there's
</I>&gt;<i> only one functional addition still required (addition of a way to
</I>&gt;<i> GREASE retry_config values), the rest of the work to create the
</I>&gt;<i> PR (that'll undoubted change lots as we go) should be pretty much just
</I>&gt;<i> build/git stuff.
