</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It looks like Google includes a self-signed root CA in the wire
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certificate chain, and if no match is found in the trust store,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you'll get the reported error.
</I>&gt;<i> What do people think about this practice of including the root in the chain?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can see, neither PKIX (RFC 5280) nor the CA/BF Baseline Requirements say anything about the practice, though I may have missed something. I had a vague memory that some standard or &quot;best practice&quot; guideline somewhere said the server should send the chain up to but not including the root, but I don't know what that might have been.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the one hand, including the root doesn't help with path validation: either some certificate along the chain is a trust anchor already, in which case there's no need to include the root; or it isn't, in which case the peer has no reason to trust the chain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other, it's useful for debugging, and perhaps for quickly finding whether the highest intermediate in the chain is signed by a trusted root if that intermediate is missing an AKID (though we'd hope that isn't the case).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can also see an application deferring trust to the user in this case: &quot;this chain ends in this root, which you don't currently trust, but maybe you'd like to add it?&quot;. Which doesn't seem like a great plan either -- and PKIX says trust anchors should be added using a trustworthy out-of-band procedure, which this is not -- but I suppose it's a conceivable use case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The only thing I'd like to add to this is that whenever I *do* include 
the root anchor in a website and run Qualys' ssllabs test on it, I get a 
(minor) warning:

Additional Certificates (if supplied)
Certificates provided &#160;&#160;&#160; 3 (5051 bytes)
*Chain issues &#160;&#160;&#160; Contains anchor*

Unfortunately their documentation does not state *why* they print out 
this warning or why it would be bad, but I normally remove the trust 
anchor from the webserver certificate chain nevertheless.&#160; It could very 
well be that I'm not the only web admin that follows their advice in 
this respect.
