Exactly...
(Do you think about the MacGyver/StarTrek/A-Team/Leverage/MissionImpossible
plot line that goes along with each engineering decision?...)

    &gt; validating servers. And the iDevID is not really intended for operational
    &gt; use. Rather it is the security bootstrap for the lDevID. See the work being
    &gt; done in the ANIMA workgroup as an example of what to do with this. Michael
    &gt; Richardson, who recently joined this list is working on the related Internet
    &gt; Draft(s).

    &gt; I should test out a cert beyond 2038 on my armv7 32 bit Cubieboard. Will try
    &gt; that tomorrow....

    &gt; I HAVE made certs with this value and I am displaying their content. But that
    &gt; system is off right now. I will get one of the samples also tomorrow.

    &gt; And yes, the industry does need to think some about this...

I suspect that the value: literal value 99991231235959Z will simply come to
mean &quot;the end of time&quot;, even after the year 10,000.  It has a well known
DER encoding, and one can memcmp() it.
Perhaps we will define an OID which means &quot;no expiry&quot;, and start including
that.  I don't think the expiry date is an optional part.

I will also have example vouchers, voucher requests and ECDSA (&quot;prime256v1&quot;)
certs with known private keys (so you can replicate my work) for the ANIMA
BRSKI document, perhaps next week.  I'd rather publish Curve25519/EdDSA
examples, but it's too bleeding edge for the moment.
