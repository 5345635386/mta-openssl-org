Actually I think we were using git at that point. I calculate it at
about 8 months at the point of that commit before the 1.0.2 release.

IIRC 1.0.2 had a very long and protracted release period. It actually
went into beta at the end of February 2014. Shortly afterwards
heartbleed hit and we had our minds on other things for a bit, so it
didn't get released until January 2015. The 1.0.2 branch was in &quot;feature
freeze&quot; during that whole period - so that is almost certainly the
reason why this wasn't backported.

Perhaps if we had realised in May 2014 that we weren't going to release
1.0.2 for another 8 months then we might have made different decisions.
