</I>&gt;<i> That's not ideal, since it's looking at an internal representation. Also, for some reason, 1.0.2 seems to keep the year as a two-digit value for ASN.1 UTC Time, with a window centered on 1970, while it uses a 4-digit year for ASN.1 Generalized Time. The code handles that but it makes me nervous - it's the sort of internal detail that seems likely to change.
</I>Really?&#160; I thought the standard window for the two-digit representation
in the DER/BER encoding was centered on 2000, at least in certificates.
But I may be mistaken.

&gt;<i> struct tm is local time, so you need to adjust for timezone. With Generalized Time you need to parse the offset from UTC; then you adjust your struct tm based on the difference between the ASN.1 time's offset and your local offset.
</I>It's not as much struct tm, as it is the mktime() API.&#160; If
available, try the BSD/GNU API timegm(), although that is
officially &quot;obsolete&quot;.

Or you could go pure C and use the integer arithmetic that
converts broken-down Gregorian dates to a day count since an
arbitrary base, either the Gauss formula, or something based on:

 &#160;((month &lt; 3u ? month - 3u : month + 9u) * 367u + Yu) / 12u + mday

(Y is a single digit constant, forgot which).

(That particular formula is my reconstruction of how the calendar
was probably designed by the advisor to Julius Caesar: Worst case
year is 367 days, divide equally among 12 months, restart about 20
days before spring equinox, use a historic rounding rule represented
by Y. Of cause with Roman numerals, they would have used (month - 2)).

Enjoy
