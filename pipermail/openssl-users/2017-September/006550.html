I'm not familiar with those extensions and will need to do more research.

However, it sounds like you're assuming a CA-issued certificate where we
have the CA certificate in the trust list.

That's not the case.&#160; These are (in the most relevant cases) self-signed
certificates or CA-issued certificates where we have only the leaf
certificate in the trust list.

I suspect that they are indeed falling into that last case, where the
only way to know which certificate in the trust list is &quot;right&quot; is to
try the crypto verification on each trusted certificate until one
succeeds.&#160; (Or just compare the certificate presented with the ones in
the trust list.)
