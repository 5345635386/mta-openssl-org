Never was into watching TV.  Maybe saw half a dozen MI and maybe 4 - 5 
StarTrek, so I really can't answer this...  :)

Nice thought.  Not really an option.

&gt;<i> I will also have example vouchers, voucher requests and ECDSA (&quot;prime256v1&quot;)

</I>
Do we agree on the DN and SAN content per 802.1AR?  I am not entirely 
confident with my reading of what I contributed to!  Well at that time I 
left the cert profile to others.  I can send you a whole pki tree zipped 
up.  Do you have any 'live' specimens?


&gt;<i> I'd rather publish Curve25519/EdDSA examples, but it's too bleeding edge for the moment.

We wait until 1.1.1 ships.  But MAYBE we should be doing builds and 
testing now instead of after it ships...

Odds are it won't make a difference.
