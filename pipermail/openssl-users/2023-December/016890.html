<PRE>My understanding is that openssl does not guarantee binary compatibility at major releases.

 

A big value-add of the distros like RHEL is that they recompile everything and guarantee that it all works.  Replacing with a custom openssl, or any other system library, will probably break applications.

 

I would try either static link to your old version or link to a local old version, but not install openssl in the system area.

 

The ideal solution would be to get your customers off RHEL7, which was end of life 3 years ago, but you may have no choice.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Question about Open SSL 1.0.2 series compatibility

 

I&#8217;m supporting a project that has been using the openssl 1.&#8202;0.&#8202;0 series built for RHEL7 for some time now. OpenSSL 1.&#8202;1.&#8202;1 has breaking API changes, so I&#8217;ve built OpenSSL 1.&#8202;0.&#8202;2u for starters in order to upgrade to that version first, 



I&#8217;m supporting a project that has been using the openssl 1.0.0 series built for RHEL7 for some time now.  OpenSSL 1.1.1 has breaking API changes, so I&#8217;ve built OpenSSL 1.0.2u for starters in order to upgrade to that version first, but I am building for both RHEL7 and RHEL8.  I have a couple of questions that I haven&#8217;t found answers for searching the web yet.

 

Is OpenSSL 1.0.2 compatible with native apps built for RHEL8?  Although it might not be ideal can it work on RHEL8?  I&#8217;ve built it on RHEL8 and I have used the openssl binary to read some cert files with the x509 sub-command, and it seems to produce the same results on RHEL7 and RHEL8 using the program from within bash shell.  That leads me to believe that I should be able to link a native c++ app with openssl 1.0.2u and run that on RHEL8 successfully.  

 

Is OpenSSL 1.1.1 compatible with RHEL7?
