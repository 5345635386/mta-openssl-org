<PRE>Hi there,

</I>&gt;<i> downstream seg fault.&#160; I have not been able to find where that 
</I>&gt;<i> function is defined.&#160; I used grep on the openssl code and couldn&#8217;t 
</I>&gt;<i> find a function definition to read.&#160; If anyone could help me 
</I>&gt;<i> understand why that is, I would appreciate it.&#160; It doesn&#8217;t look like a 
</I>&gt;<i> MACRO but perhaps it is exported from somewhere but I cannot find the 
</I>&gt;<i> function implementation so that I can read the code and figure out how 
</I>&gt;<i> to debug it.&#160; I&#8217;ve built openssl with debug symbols, and I cannot step 
</I>&gt;<i> into that function with &#8216;gnu ddd&#8217; nor can I figure out how to navigate 
</I>&gt;<i> to the function implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
FWIW:
 &#160; PEM_read_X509 comes from `include/openssl/pem.h` (in conjunction with 
`crypto/pem/pem_lib.c` and pem_x509.c):

 &#160; IMPLEMENT_PEM_rw(X509, X509, PEM_STRING_X509, X509)

resulting in
309 # define IMPLEMENT_PEM_rw(name, type, str, asn1) \
310&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; IMPLEMENT_PEM_read(name, type, str, asn1) \
311&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; IMPLEMENT_PEM_write(name, type, str, asn1)

resulting in

305 # define IMPLEMENT_PEM_read(name, type, str, asn1) \
306&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; IMPLEMENT_PEM_read_bio(name, type, str, asn1) \
307&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; IMPLEMENT_PEM_read_fp(name, type, str, asn1)

leading to

221 #&#160; define IMPLEMENT_PEM_read_fp(name, type, str, asn1) \
222 type *PEM_read_##name(FILE *fp, type **x, pem_password_cb *cb, void *u)\
223 { \
224 return PEM_ASN1_read((d2i_of_void *)d2i_##asn1, str,fp,(void 
**)x,cb,u); \
225 }

which, as far as I can tell, results in

X509&#160; *PEM_read_X509(FILE *fp, X509 **x, pem_password_cb *cb, void *u)\
 &#160;{
 &#160;&#160; return PEM_ASN1_read((d2i_of_void *)d2i_X509, 
PEM_STRING_X509,fp,(void **)x,cb,u); \
}

(I am sure I am missing some substitutions here).
Having said that:
- yes, you can build and link OpenSSL 1.1.1 (or OpenSSL 3+) on RHEL7 but 
*don't* try to replace system libssl.so/libcrypto.so libraries - it will 
break your RHEL support.
- yes, you can build and link the fully obsolete OpenSSL 1.0.2 on RHEL8 
but again, *don't* try to replace system libssl.so/libcrypto.so 
libraries - it will break your RHEL support.
- openssl 1.0.2 and 1.1.1. are (rather subtly) API incompatible, so 
don't mix and match
- my advice is to build and link statically using your own build of 
OpenSSL 1.1.1 - RedHat tends to apply tons of patches to OpenSSL

HTH,

JJK

</I>&gt;<i> My understanding is that openssl does not guarantee binary 
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility at major releases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A big value-add of the distros like RHEL is that they recompile 
</I>&gt;<i> everything and guarantee that it all works.&#160; Replacing with a custom 
</I>&gt;<i> openssl, or any other system library, will probably break applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would try either static link to your old version or link to a local 
</I>&gt;<i> old version, but not install openssl in the system area.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ideal solution would be to get your customers off RHEL7, which was 
</I>&gt;<i> end of life 3 years ago, but you may have no choice.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m supporting a project that has been using the openssl 1.&#8202;0.&#8202;0 
</I>&gt;<i> series built for RHEL7 for some time now. OpenSSL 1.&#8202;1.&#8202;1 has breaking

</I>&gt;<i> built for RHEL7 for some time now.&#160; OpenSSL 1.1.1 has breaking API

</I>&gt;<i> to that version first, but I am building for both RHEL7 and RHEL8.&#160; I 
</I>&gt;<i> have a couple of questions that I haven&#8217;t found answers for searching 
</I>&gt;<i> the web yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is OpenSSL 1.0.2 compatible with native apps built for RHEL8?&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> Although it might not be ideal can it work on RHEL8?&#160; I&#8217;ve built it on 
</I>&gt;<i> RHEL8 and I have used the openssl binary to read some cert files with 
</I>&gt;<i> the x509 sub-command, and it seems to produce the same results on 
</I>&gt;<i> RHEL7 and RHEL8 using the program from within bash shell.&#160; That leads 
</I>&gt;<i> me to believe that I should be able to link a native c++ app with 
</I>&gt;<i> openssl 1.0.2u and run that on RHEL8 successfully.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is OpenSSL 1.1.1 compatible with RHEL7?
