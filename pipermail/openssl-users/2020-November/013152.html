<PRE>There's another reason why you'll want to close your socket with
SSL_close(): SSL (and TLS) view a prematurely-closed stream as an
exceptional condition to be reported to the application. This is to
prevent truncation attacks against the data communication layer.
While your application may not need that level of protection, it helps
to keep the state of your application in lockstep with the state of
the TLS protocol.  If your application doesn't expect to send any more
data, SSL_close() sends another record across the TCP connection to
tell the remote side that it should not keep the descriptor open.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Does the server parent process close its copy of the conversation socket?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I checked in my code, but it seems that no. Is it needed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You'll want to do it, for a few reasons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - You'll be leaking descriptors in the server, and eventually it will hit its limit.
</I>&gt;<i> - If the child process dies without cleanly closing its end of the conversation,
</I>&gt;<i> the parent will still have an open descriptor for the socket, so the network stack
</I>&gt;<i> won't terminate the TCP connection.
</I>&gt;<i> - A related problem: If the child just closes its socket without calling shutdown,
</I>&gt;<i> no FIN will be sent to the client system (because the parent still has its copy of
</I>&gt;<i> the socket open). The client system will have the connection in one of the termination
</I>&gt;<i> states (FIN_WAIT, maybe? I don't have my references handy) until it times out.
</I>&gt;<i> - A bug in the parent process might cause it to operate on the connected socket,
</I>&gt;<i> causing unexpected traffic on the connection.
</I>&gt;<i> - All such sockets will be inherited by future child processes, and one of them might
</I>&gt;<i> erroneously perform some operation on one of them. Obviously there could also be a
</I>&gt;<i> security issue with this, depending on what your application does.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, when a descriptor is &quot;handed off&quot; to a child process by forking, you
</I>&gt;<i> generally want to close it in the parent, unless it's used for parent-child
</I>&gt;<i> communication. (There are some cases where the parent wants to keep it open for
</I>&gt;<i> some reason, but they're rare.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a similar note, if you exec a different program in the child process (I wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> sure from your description), it's a good idea for the parent to set the FD_CLOEXEC
</I>&gt;<i> option (with fcntl) on its listening socket and any other descriptors that shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> be passed along to child processes. You could close these manually in the child
</I>&gt;<i> process between the fork and exec, but FD_CLOEXEC is often easier to maintain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For some applications, you might just dup2 the socket over descriptor 0 or
</I>&gt;<i> descriptor 3, depending on whether the child needs access to stdio, and then close
</I>&gt;<i> everything higher.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Closing descriptors not needed by the child process is a good idea even if you
</I>&gt;<i> don't exec, since it can prevent various problems and vulnerabilities that result
</I>&gt;<i> from certain classes of bugs. It's a defensive measure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The best source for this sort of recommendation, in my opinion, remains W. Richard
</I>&gt;<i> Stevens' /Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment/. The book is old, and Linux
</I>&gt;<i> isn't UNIX, but I don't know of any better explanation of how and why to do things
</I>&gt;<i> in a UNIX-like OS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And my favorite source of TCP/IP information is Stevens' /TCP/IP Illustrated/.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; May it explain my problem?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this case, I don't offhand see how it does, but I may be overlooking something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I suppose that, if for some reason, the communication with the client is lost
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (crash of client, loss of network, etc.) and keepalive is not enabled, this may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fully explain my problem ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would give you those symptoms, yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If yes, do you have an idea of why keepalive is not enabled?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Host Requirements RFC mandates that it be disabled by default. I think the
</I>&gt;<i> primary reasoning for that was to avoid re-establishing virtual circuits (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> dial-up connections) for long-running connections that had long idle periods.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Linux may well have a kernel tunable or similar to enable TCP keepalive by
</I>&gt;<i> default, but it seems to be switched off on your system. You'd have to consult
</I>&gt;<i> the documentation for your distribution, I think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By default (again per the Host Requirements RFC), it takes quite a long time for
</I>&gt;<i> TCP keepalive to detect a broken connection. It doesn't start probing until the
</I>&gt;<i> connection has been idle for 2 hours, and then you have to wait for the TCP
</I>&gt;<i> retransmit timer times the retransmit count to be exhausted - typically over 10
</I>&gt;<i> minutes. Again, some OSes let you change these defaults, and some let you change
</I>&gt;<i> them on an individual connection.
