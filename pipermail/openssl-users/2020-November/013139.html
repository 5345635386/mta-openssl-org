<PRE>Hello Michael,

Thanks for all those information.

I corrected your suggested point (close parent process sockets). I also
activated keepalive, with values adapted to my application.

I hope this will solve my issue, but as the problem may take several weeks
to occur, I will not know immediately if this was the origin :-)

Many thanks for your help.

Regards,
Brice

&gt;<i> &gt; From: Brice Andr&#233; &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">brice at famille-andre.be</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sent: Friday, 13 November, 2020 09:13
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Does the server parent process close its copy of the conversation
</I>&gt;<i> socket?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I checked in my code, but it seems that no. Is it needed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You'll want to do it, for a few reasons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - You'll be leaking descriptors in the server, and eventually it will hit
</I>&gt;<i> its limit.
</I>&gt;<i> - If the child process dies without cleanly closing its end of the
</I>&gt;<i> conversation,
</I>&gt;<i> the parent will still have an open descriptor for the socket, so the
</I>&gt;<i> network stack
</I>&gt;<i> won't terminate the TCP connection.
</I>&gt;<i> - A related problem: If the child just closes its socket without calling
</I>&gt;<i> shutdown,
</I>&gt;<i> no FIN will be sent to the client system (because the parent still has its
</I>&gt;<i> copy of
</I>&gt;<i> the socket open). The client system will have the connection in one of the
</I>&gt;<i> termination
</I>&gt;<i> states (FIN_WAIT, maybe? I don't have my references handy) until it times
</I>&gt;<i> out.
</I>&gt;<i> - A bug in the parent process might cause it to operate on the connected
</I>&gt;<i> socket,
</I>&gt;<i> causing unexpected traffic on the connection.
</I>&gt;<i> - All such sockets will be inherited by future child processes, and one of
</I>&gt;<i> them might
</I>&gt;<i> erroneously perform some operation on one of them. Obviously there could
</I>&gt;<i> also be a
</I>&gt;<i> security issue with this, depending on what your application does.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, when a descriptor is &quot;handed off&quot; to a child process by
</I>&gt;<i> forking, you
</I>&gt;<i> generally want to close it in the parent, unless it's used for parent-child
</I>&gt;<i> communication. (There are some cases where the parent wants to keep it
</I>&gt;<i> open for
</I>&gt;<i> some reason, but they're rare.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a similar note, if you exec a different program in the child process (I
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> sure from your description), it's a good idea for the parent to set the
</I>&gt;<i> FD_CLOEXEC
</I>&gt;<i> option (with fcntl) on its listening socket and any other descriptors that
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> be passed along to child processes. You could close these manually in the
</I>&gt;<i> child
</I>&gt;<i> process between the fork and exec, but FD_CLOEXEC is often easier to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For some applications, you might just dup2 the socket over descriptor 0 or
</I>&gt;<i> descriptor 3, depending on whether the child needs access to stdio, and
</I>&gt;<i> then close
</I>&gt;<i> everything higher.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Closing descriptors not needed by the child process is a good idea even if
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> don't exec, since it can prevent various problems and vulnerabilities that
</I>&gt;<i> result
</I>&gt;<i> from certain classes of bugs. It's a defensive measure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The best source for this sort of recommendation, in my opinion, remains W.
</I>&gt;<i> Richard
</I>&gt;<i> Stevens' /Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment/. The book is old,
</I>&gt;<i> and Linux
</I>&gt;<i> isn't UNIX, but I don't know of any better explanation of how and why to
</I>&gt;<i> do things
</I>&gt;<i> in a UNIX-like OS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And my favorite source of TCP/IP information is Stevens' /TCP/IP
</I>&gt;<i> Illustrated/.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; May it explain my problem?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this case, I don't offhand see how it does, but I may be overlooking
</I>&gt;<i> something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I suppose that, if for some reason, the communication with the client is
</I>&gt;<i> lost
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (crash of client, loss of network, etc.) and keepalive is not enabled,
</I>&gt;<i> this may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fully explain my problem ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would give you those symptoms, yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If yes, do you have an idea of why keepalive is not enabled?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Host Requirements RFC mandates that it be disabled by default. I think
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> primary reasoning for that was to avoid re-establishing virtual circuits
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> dial-up connections) for long-running connections that had long idle
</I>&gt;<i> periods.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Linux may well have a kernel tunable or similar to enable TCP keepalive by
</I>&gt;<i> default, but it seems to be switched off on your system. You'd have to
</I>&gt;<i> consult
</I>&gt;<i> the documentation for your distribution, I think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By default (again per the Host Requirements RFC), it takes quite a long
</I>&gt;<i> time for
</I>&gt;<i> TCP keepalive to detect a broken connection. It doesn't start probing
</I>&gt;<i> until the
</I>&gt;<i> connection has been idle for 2 hours, and then you have to wait for the TCP
</I>&gt;<i> retransmit timer times the retransmit count to be exhausted - typically
</I>&gt;<i> over 10
</I>&gt;<i> minutes. Again, some OSes let you change these defaults, and some let you
</I>&gt;<i> change
</I>&gt;<i> them on an individual connection.
