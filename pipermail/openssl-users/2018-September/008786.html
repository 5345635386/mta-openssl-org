</I>&gt;<i> There are plenty of other channels that can be used to validate the PGP public key used to confirm the signature of the OpenSSL tarball. None of them are secure in themselves, but by using multiple channels, the defender greatly increases the attacker's work factor and risk of discovery. That's the whole point of defense in depth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not hard to learn how to install an OpenPGP implementation (most likely gpg) and use it to verify a detached signature. There are many tutorials available online. I don't think a lack of experience with PGP or gpg is a valid excuse for not validating the signature.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes. And this is a much more likely source of problems than a counterfeit OpenSSL distribution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>To make it clear, I am very experienced and do in fact check the gpg 
signature
if possible.&#160; I was trying to give good advice to the OP based on my 
experience
checking the only ways that the OpenSSL foundation provides.

The OpenPGP/GPG key servers that you suggested, by design, accept any 
made up
key identity and thus provide no indication of validity, so just 
downloading
the key from there is a non-solution to the problem of bootstrapping 
trust in
someones first OpenSSL download.

To my knowledge the only ways to check that the .asc file was signed 
with an
authorized release key are:

A) Trusting that the HTTPS connection to the download server is 
uncompromised,
 &#160; essentially treating at least the first such signature as a glorified
 &#160; .sha256 file.

B) Checking doc/fingerprints.txt in the previous tarball and hoping the 
OpenSSL
 &#160; foundation double checks the correctness of that file before signing 
a new
 &#160; tarball.

C) Using the text (BUT NOT THE INSECURE LINKS) on
 &#160; <A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/community/omc.html">https://www.openssl.org/community/omc.html</A>
 &#160;&#160; But this lists some unauthorized keys, and also relies on that same 
HTTPS
 &#160; certificate.


Enjoy
