So here are the things mentioned in the paper:
1) Some things that were believed to require preimage resistance
   need collision resistance.  This by itself reduces security bits
   of the hashes by a factor 2.  Assuming MD5 and SHA1 didn't have
   any problem with collision resistance it would be reduced from
   128 and 160 bit to 64 and 80.  But they have a problem with
   collision resistance and so it's worse, specially for MD5.
2) Some implementations support MD5 based signatures in TLS 1.2
3) Some implementations accept the MD5 based signatures in TLS 1.2
   while it would appear they didn't.   

SLOTH really is just about 1).  It says that you should stop using
MD5 and really look at stopping to use SHA1.  And so 2) and 3) are
just 2 cases where MD5 is used.

But just fixing 2) and 3) is just fixing the problem with MD5,
while we should also look at stopping SHA1.  TLS 1.0 and 1.1 use
MD5 + SHA1, so while those are enabled we're stuck at the level of
SHA1.
