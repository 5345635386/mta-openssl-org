<PRE>In the future, I will not have an initial TCP 1/0 packet (clue) to process.
So I have no way to decide if my forked/spawned process should SSL_connect
or SSL_accept.

For example, I cannot see how this can be done with Apple's network
framework
(at least not yet).  It appears to be so high level as to not allow me
to process a TCP packet within a TLS style connection.  I realize that this
is not
an openssl issue.  And I do have things working today with Apples security
framework and openssl (with that extra TCP packet clue in place).  I am
more familiar
with openssl and I'm trying to code everything there first.  Also my entire
application
runs on linux so I am able to test all the combinations easily from there.
And I'll
need it to work with Apple's networking in the future as their security
APIs go away.

Thank you for bearing with me so far!
