<PRE>Hello-

I am updating my Linux application from using OpenSSL 1.0.2 to 1.1.1 in preparation for OpenSSL 3.0 (and of course the EOL of 1.0.2). I'm confused about the function in the subject line as well as other, related sk_X509_* functions.

My code has always used these functions, and currently my code compiles and runs successfully against 1.1.1. I was sort of doing an audit of my code, evaluating the API calls that have changed vs not changed when I noticed these functions. I searched for them in the 1.1.1 source. They don't exist, except where called in x509_lu.c. In the 1.0.2 code base, they are called in the same file, as well as are defined in a header, /include/openssl/safestack.h.

My question is, how are those symbols in my application being resolved since they are no longer found in the safestack.h header file?

My system previously had OpenSSL 1.0.2 installed when I installed 1.1.1, but I don't think I have any old headers around that are being found when I compile and link. But for some reason this works. They obviously work within the OpenSSL 1.1.1 code also.

I'm thinking I could be missing something basic about the compile/link process that explains this. Any ideas?

Thanks in advance.
