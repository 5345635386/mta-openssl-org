<PRE>Hi Phil,
Thanks for such a fast response!  I am doing the polling today.

I believe I left something very important out of my original question.
I only have 1 well known port to accept all of my connections.

TLS_client_app -&gt; service on portA (needs to be a TLS_server)
TLS_server_app -&gt; service on portA (needs to be a TLS_client)

The problem is that when the service accept()'s the connection it does
not know what type of app made the connection so it cannot decide
if it should act as the TLS client or server (unless I send a 1/0 hint
over TCP first).

Kris
