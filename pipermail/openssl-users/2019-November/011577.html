<PRE>First, thanks to everyone for all the useful feedback.  I really appreciate
it!

Let me try to explain my situation again as to why I need a service to do
both.

1. I have a single service listening on a well known port.  it is a backup
service that runs on the backup server which will always be
the TLS_server (will always have a certificate).  The same service runs on
multiple backup clients where it acts as the TLS_client,
listening for connections from the backup server.
2. In a common mode, a separate backup server process (TLS_server) will
connect to it and the backup service needs to act as a TLS_client.
3. In another mode a backup client (TLS_client) will connect the backup
service on the backup server and that service needs to act as a TLS_server

It sounds like peeking at the port may be the simplest way to determine how
it is being connected to.
As I write this I realize that the service running on all of the other
backup clients really only needs 2.
In this case, the backup client is a TLS_client, but it will be doing the
TCP accept.  No need to decide
which mode to use in this case..  It is the backup server's backup service
that needs to do both
and will always be a linux server, so setting up peek should work well.

Apple has a network framework (supports TLS 1.3) that I believe will
eventually replace the current security framework (supports
up to TLS 1.2) that I am using today to get the job done.  There is example
code here:

<A HREF="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/implementing_netcat_with_network_framework">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/implementing_netcat_with_network_framework</A>

I have been experimenting with this code.  I could not get it to work on
Mojave, but I could get it
to work on Catalina.  To summarize how I think it works:

1. You set up all of the connection parameters up front (TCP, TLS, TLS-PSK,
UDP, bonjour, etc, etc).
2. Next, create an endpoint using nw_endpoint_create_host
3. In the case of a service (listener) call nw_listener_create with the
parameters.

You now have an opaque object and in TLS mode, I do not see a way to access
the underlying TCP socket.
I've just realized that I need to do more testing against my common, but
odd case, where my client's
backup service needs to accept, but process w/o a cert as a TLS_client.
Joy!

Doing more digging today, I find in

__BEGIN_COMMENTS__
I've not seen an equivalent way of message peeking
Such a mechanism does not exist.

or even getting the &#8230; socket.
Nor does that, at least in general.  Network framework was designed to work
in conjunction with our user space networking stack, and that stack does
not have an underlying socket because sockets are a kernel-only concept.

Now, on macOS, Network framework does actually talk to the kernel, but
that&#8217;s just a compatibility measure: We can&#8217;t enable the user space
networking stack on the Mac while continuing to support Network Kernel
Extensions (NKEs).  NKEs have been informally deprecated for a while now,
so the expectation is that they&#8217;ll be formally deprecated and then removed
in future OS releases, at which point macOS will work like all our other
OSes in this regard.

You can learn more about the background to this in:

WWDC 2017 Session 707 Advances in Networking, Part 1

WWDC 2018 Session 715 Introducing Network Framework

All of this is to say that, if you can&#8217;t do what you want with Network
framework, the time to an enhancement request for the facilities that you
need is now.
__END_COMMENTS

It appears that if you do not keep up with the apple way of doing things on
OSX at some point you will be locked out?
