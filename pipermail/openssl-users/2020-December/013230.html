<PRE>Ok, so I am not actually going to populate EVP_PKEY with a private key 
in the callback function:
int (*client_cert_cb)(SSL *ssl, X509 **x509, *EVP_PKEY **pkey*)?

Instead, I will call
EVP_PKEY *ENGINE_load_private_key(ENGINE *e, const char *key_id, 
UI_METHOD *ui_method, void *callback_data);
to get the EVP_PKEY, which will be used by OpenSSL to access the Smart Card.

Once I get the resulting EVP_PKEY using ENGINE_load_private_key(...), 
how do I assign it to pkey in the callback function?
If I had private key I would use something like
EVP_PKEY_assign_RSA(..)
Since I don't actually have a private key, should I use something else?



Thanks,
George

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then what ought to happen is that you pass that pkey to OpenSSL where you need an EVP_PKEY, and OpenSSL will call the engine's appropriate method for whatever it needs to do, and the engine will tell the smartcard &quot;do this thing using the key with this identifier&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest you refer to a example such as the PPP code that Jan cited to see how it does this sort of thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or you can take the approach that Paul suggests in his reply of writing your own engine specifically for your hardware, if you don't need generic PKCS#11 support. Basically, PKCS#11 gives you support for more devices, and in principle should do some of the work for you; but as Paul suggests, the PKCS#11 API and its dependence on external drivers and libraries means it's not easy to work with. In some cases where you only need to support one type of device (or a family of devices that all use the same driver / library) it might well be easier to just write a simple engine that only supports the features you need. You can use the source for the existing engines in OpenSSL to get an idea of what that looks like.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few years back I forked the OpenSSL CAPI engine to make some fixes and enhancements, and that was pretty straightforward.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you have a well-documented API for your particular smartcard, with handy functions like &quot;do this to get an RSA signature of a blob of data with this key ID and these parameters&quot;, you may want to try Paul's route. Really depends on your requirements and what kind of support you already have for your device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And all of this changes in 3.0 with the new &quot;provider&quot; architecture, so you'll get to take another crack at it soon.
