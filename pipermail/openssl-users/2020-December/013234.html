</I>like Michael pointed out, my&#160; eap-tls code is just an example of how you 
could handle a pkcs11 device; it does not us a callback at all, but my 
code loads the client cert+key upfront and avoids having to use a client 
callback altogether.

I guess you could also use a client callback for this (perhaps in 
combination with SSL_CTX_set_client_cert_engine()) . In that case you 
would get the (pseudo) key from the engine like this
 &#160;&#160; EVP_PKEY *engine_key = ENGINE_load_private_key(ENGINE *e, const char 
*key_id, UI_METHOD *ui_method, void *callback_data);
and then set
 &#160; pkey = &amp;engine_key;
and see if that works.
Note that the ENGINE_load_private_key() function *does* return a 
EVP_PKEY struct but that does not mean the entire private key is 
contained in it; a private key consists of a modulus and a private part 
(exponent, prime1, prime2, exponent1, exponent2 etc). the 
ENGINE_load_private_key() call will return a struct containing the 
modulus but not the rest. You then use the engine to do the actual 
encryption and decryption.

HTH,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You can't get the private key from the smartcard. Instead, you have to let the engine do the encryption. I don't know what ENGINE_load_private_key actually does - in my PKCS#11 work I didn't have to get into this - but I suspect it just puts a key identifier into pkey.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then what ought to happen is that you pass that pkey to OpenSSL where you need an EVP_PKEY, and OpenSSL will call the engine's appropriate method for whatever it needs to do, and the engine will tell the smartcard &quot;do this thing using the key with this identifier&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I suggest you refer to a example such as the PPP code that Jan cited to see how it does this sort of thing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or you can take the approach that Paul suggests in his reply of writing your own engine specifically for your hardware, if you don't need generic PKCS#11 support. Basically, PKCS#11 gives you support for more devices, and in principle should do some of the work for you; but as Paul suggests, the PKCS#11 API and its dependence on external drivers and libraries means it's not easy to work with. In some cases where you only need to support one type of device (or a family of devices that all use the same driver / library) it might well be easier to just write a simple engine that only supports the features you need. You can use the source for the existing engines in OpenSSL to get an idea of what that looks like.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A few years back I forked the OpenSSL CAPI engine to make some fixes and enhancements, and that was pretty straightforward.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So if you have a well-documented API for your particular smartcard, with handy functions like &quot;do this to get an RSA signature of a blob of data with this key ID and these parameters&quot;, you may want to try Paul's route. Really depends on your requirements and what kind of support you already have for your device.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And all of this changes in 3.0 with the new &quot;provider&quot; architecture, so you'll get to take another crack at it soon.
