     I was somewhat puzzled by this also. Yes.

     I am still digging into the issue.
     I thank you the thoughtful reply.


&gt;<i> As to why its happening my first guess would be that more recent compilers
</I>&gt;<i> like gcc and clang do lazy symbol resolution, only resolving a subordonate
</I>&gt;<i> symbol, when its calling parent is found to be used.  Given
</I>&gt;<i> ossl_quic_stream_recv_get_final_size isn't called anywhere in
</I>&gt;<i> comp_stream_test.c, the compiler disposes of the symbol prior to any need
</I>&gt;<i> to resolve its called symbols, and so everything is ok.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
     I also suspect a linker issue here and the sad fact is that the GNU
  ld just will not suffice in this server. C'est la vie ici.


&gt;<i> conversely (again, I'm guessing here) the solaris 5.10 compiler likely take
</I>&gt;<i> a more bulldozer-ish approach, leaving everything in the object file and
</I>&gt;<i> only stripping symbols after all resolutions are complete, leading to the
</I>&gt;<i> missing symbols error, despite its not being needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
     I have to laugh at the &quot;bulldozer&quot; idea as you are likely quite 
correct there.


&gt;<i> As to what to do about this...I'm unsure.  The quick hack I would imagine
</I>&gt;<i> would be to move the definition of ossl_quic_stream_recv_get_final_size
</I>&gt;<i> into a c file (likely quic_stream_map.c) and just declare a prototype in
</I>&gt;<i> the quic_stream_map.h header, so as to avoid the unneeded symbol
</I>&gt;<i> resolution.  You would have to lather rinse  repeat with the other missing
</I>&gt;<i> symbols of course.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As to your prior question about how long the ability to support SunOS will
</I>&gt;<i> last, well, unfortunately I don't think any of us can say.  I believe the
</I>&gt;<i> platoform you are building on is on our unadpoted platform list:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/policies/general-supplemental/platforms.html">https://www.openssl.org/policies/general-supplemental/platforms.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And while we endeavor to keep openssl building on as many platforms as
</I>&gt;<i> possible, its not feasible to cover all the currently
</I>&gt;<i> unmaintained platforms.  You do have some agency here however. If you are
</I>&gt;<i> willing and interested, you could volunteer to be a community platform
</I>&gt;<i> maintainer for your target platform.  This would entail you building
</I>&gt;<i> openssl on your adopted platform, and running the test suite routinely,
</I>&gt;<i> reporting bugs and fixing errors as they occur.  Its not a small amount of
</I>&gt;<i> work, but it would be a significant contribution toward ensuring that
</I>&gt;<i> openssl stays viable on the targets you need.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I can tell you that this morning I see :

Which seems to work like a charm and I do have a few patches.

What I would like to do is climb in and see what can be done to create a
pure ISO 9899:1990 clean code path. May be reduced in features but would
still work pretty much everywhere. Maybe.

Sure do wish I had my old Oracle support contract to update this server
a bit but they want a LOT of money for that.
