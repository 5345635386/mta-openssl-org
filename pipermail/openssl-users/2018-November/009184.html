Thanks for confirming, it is then not surprising I failed to find
the relevant interfaces. :-)

</I>
Quick question about that, since the client may also sign the key
exchange when a client certificate is requested and returned, what
is held on the server in s-&gt;s3-&gt;tmp.sigalg?  [ I expect still the
signature the server used in its CertificateVerify. And on the
client side, I would expect this to hold the algorithm used by the
client to sign its ClientVerify if a client cert was used. ]

And it seems that on the server side s-&gt;s3-&gt;peer_tmp does actually
hold the client's key exchange public key, which is necessarily for
the same group as the server, so all we'd need to do is remove that
'explicit check' and that key be visible on the server side, right?
