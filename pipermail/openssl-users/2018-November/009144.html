<PRE>Hi Nick

Have You tried The FooKey Method ? <A HREF="https://foocrypt.net/the-fookey-method">https://foocrypt.net/the-fookey-method</A>

Also,

I will be sourcing public addendum's as addendum's to my submission into the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security [ <A HREF="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Intelligence_and_Security/TelcoAmendmentBill2018/Submissions">https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Intelligence_and_Security/TelcoAmendmentBill2018/Submissions</A> ] regarding the committee&#8217;s review of the 'Telecommunication and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018' after the Melbourne Cup. It will be similar to the open request for the Defence Trade Control Act review performed by the former Inspector General of Intelligence, Dr Vivian Thom.

Cryptopocalypse NOW 01 04 2016

Volumes 0.0 -&gt; 10.0 Now available through iTunes - iBooks @ <A HREF="https://itunes.apple.com/au/author/mark-a.-lane/id1100062966?mt=11">https://itunes.apple.com/au/author/mark-a.-lane/id1100062966?mt=11</A>

Cryptopocalypse NOW is the story behind the trials and tribulations encountered in creating &quot;FooCrypt, A Tale of Cynical Cyclical Encryption.&quot;

&quot;FooCrypt, A Tale of Cynical Cyclical Encryption.&quot; is aimed at hardening several commonly used Symmetric Open Source Encryption methods so that they are hardened to a standard that is commonly termed 'QUANTUM ENCRYPTION'.

&quot;FooCrypt, A Tale of Cynical Cyclical Encryption.&quot; is currently under export control by the Australian Department of Defence Defence Export Controls Office due to the listing of Cryptology as a &#8216;Dual Use&#8217; Technology as per the &#8216;Wassenaar Arrangement&#8217;

A permit from Defence Export Control is expected within the next 2 months as the Australian Signals Directorate is currently assessing the associated application(s) for export approval of &quot;FooCrypt, A Tale of Cynical Cyclical Encryption.&quot;

Early releases of &quot;Cryptopocalypse NOW&quot; will be available in the period leading up to June, 2016.

Limited Edition Collectors versions and Hard Back Editions are available via the store on <A HREF="http://www.foocrypt.net/">http://www.foocrypt.net/</A>
