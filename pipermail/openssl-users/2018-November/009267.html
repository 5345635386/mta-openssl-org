I think you need to get this spec clarified. It makes no sense. It seems to be
describing renegotiation, but uses the term resumption for it which has a
different meaning.

A handshake occurs between a client and a server at the start of a connection
and establishes the cryptographic parameters to be used for that connection
(including certificates/keys etc). Resumption refers to a type of handshake.
Resumptions handshakes are abbreviated forms of a full handshake. They are based
on the parameters established during a previous connection. So for example a
certificate is not exchanged because the same cert is used from the previous
connection.

Renegotiation refers to the process of starting a new handshake over an existing
TLS connection between a client and a server. Typically the objective is usually
either to update the keys, or to request a client certificate. Like any other
handshake it may be a full one or a resumption one.

Only a client can ever initiate a handshake. A server can *request* a
renegotiation by sending a HelloRequest message, but the client does not have to
honour it. A server cannot request a resumption.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;&#160; What does &quot;always on&quot; mean to you?&#160;&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Always on, means that the socket connection is up for as long as it is possible,
</I>&gt;<i> meaning that the socket is not closed and it keeps exchanging information all
</I>&gt;<i> the time (server&lt;-&gt;client)
</I>
Resumption does not give you this. Renegotiation does.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;&#160; Support session tickets? Is there just one server or a server &quot;farm&quot;?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;&#160; Do the clients support resumption?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's only 1 server, not a farm.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How can I tell if the client supports resumption?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;&#160; Or are you trying to periodically rekey a long-running connection?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe this is it.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For me, Renegotiation is request &quot;everything&quot; (new pubkey, certificates, etc)
</I>
A renegotiation is a new handshake over an existing connection. It may use a
full handshake (certificates exchanged etc), or an abbreviated resumption
handshake (e.g. doesn't exchange certificates again). Only the client gets to
decide whether to attempt a resumption.


&gt;<i> Resumption, is just to refresh the keys? I'm a little confused here.
</I>
No. Resumption is an abbreviated handshake. It may be used at the start of a new
connection or as part of a renegotiation handshake. In either case it is
abbreviated because it is based on the parameters established during an earlier
connection.
