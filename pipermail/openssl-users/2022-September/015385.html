<PRE>On an AlmaLinux 8.6 VM hosted in Proxmox:

[<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">root at certs</A> ~]# openssl verify -CAfile 
/etc/ssl/certs/local/DOMAIN.wildcards.pem 
/etc/ssl/certs/local/DOMAIN.wildcards.pem
C = US, O = Let's Encrypt, CN = R3
error 2 at 1 depth lookup: unable to get issuer certificate
error /etc/ssl/certs/local/DOMAIN.wildcards.pem: verification failed
[<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">root at certs</A> ~]# openssl version
OpenSSL 1.1.1k&#160; FIPS 25 Mar 2021

The VM has CPUs of type host.&#160; It did the same with a CPU type of 
kvm64.&#160; I switched to host because kvm64 did not pass the aes CPU flag 
through.

If I copy the PEM file to a bare metal system running Ubuntu Server 
20.04, it verifies:

<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">elyograg at bilbo</A>:~$ openssl verify -CAfile DOMAIN.wildcards.pem 
DOMAIN.wildcards.pem
DOMAIN.wildcards.pem: OK
<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">elyograg at bilbo</A>:~$ openssl version
OpenSSL 1.1.1f&#160; 31 Mar 2020

Other bare metal systems and their results with the same PEM file:

Verifies on Proxmox (the one running the VM) with openssl 1.1.1n
Verifies on Ubuntu 22.04 with openssl 3.0.2
Fails on CentOS 7.5.1804 with openssl 1.0.2k-fips

----

I also have the quictls fork of openssl on the VM, built from source, 
and it fails with exactly the same error message:

[<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">root at certs</A> ~]# /usr/local/bin/qssl verify -CAfile 
/etc/ssl/certs/local/DOMAIN.wildcards.pem 
/etc/ssl/certs/local/DOMAIN.wildcards.pem
C = US, O = Let's Encrypt, CN = R3
error 2 at 1 depth lookup: unable to get issuer certificate
error /etc/ssl/certs/local/DOMAIN.wildcards.pem: verification failed
[<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">root at certs</A> ~]# /usr/local/bin/qssl version
OpenSSL 3.0.5+quic 5 Jul 2022 (Library: OpenSSL 3.0.5+quic 5 Jul 2022)

---

I have redacted the domain name from the filename in what I pasted 
above, but everything else is untouched.&#160; The PEM file contains the 
server cert, the letsencrypt issuing cert, the private key, and 
generated dhparams.&#160; It works for most software that can handle PEM 
files for TLS.&#160; The only software I am sure about that utilizes the 
dhparams is haproxy.&#160; In case it matters, the server cert has a 4096 bit 
key.&#160; The certbot program is functioning correctly.

Does anyone have any idea why this would fail in this way?&#160; Is there 
some information I can gather that would help with troubleshooting?&#160; The 
little evidence I have says it is failing on RPM distros and passing on 
DEB distros.&#160; But the sample size is way too small to adequately support 
that hypothesis.

In the unlikely event this is an XY problem, here is the X:&#160; I am trying 
to set up a letsencrypt certificate creation/renewal system on the VM 
for work that I have running on my own server.&#160; One of the things that I 
have my script doing is validating the certificate file that it produces 
before it declares success.&#160; I would like the VM to do the same, but 
right now I can't because of this issue.

Thanks,
Shawn
