I'm not going to unilaterally claim that isn't possible, but I have never seen it.

</I>&gt;<i> Best practices do not change when there are symlinks involved, unless the software refuses to follow symlinks.  Anything that would apply to a real file/directory would apply to the target of a symlink.  My own best practices about private keys:  They should only be readable by root and whatever user/group is active when software needs to use them.  They should definitely not be writable by any user other than root.  Some software starts as root to handle security stuff, then throws away the elevated permissions and runs as an unprivileged user.  Apache httpd is a prime example of this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You might be concerned that with 777 permissions, a symlink can be modified by anyone ... but I am about 98 percent sure that is not the case when proper permissions are used.  I believe that a symlink can only be modified by a user that has write permission to the directory containing the symlink.

I was thinking of the case where the directory containing the keys (as configured) is correctly owned, but contains a symlink pointing outside of that directory somewhere else... say to a file owned by an ordinary user.

In that case, as has been pointed out, it might be sufficient to just pay attention to the owner/group/modes of the file and reject them if:

(1) the file isn't 600 or 400;
(2) the file isn't owned by root or the app-id that the app runs at.

Do we agree on that?
