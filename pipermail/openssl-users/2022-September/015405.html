This is not really related to openssl, but I will tell you what you are 
likely to hear in another setting:

In most cases, applications are not really aware of symlinks, unless 
they have been explicitly written to treat them differently than regular 
files or directories.&#160; Some software can choose to not follow symlinks, 
but usually when that is possible, the program has a configuration 
option to enable/disable that functionality.

All symlinks I have ever seen on POSIX systems have 777 permissions, and 
MOST of the symlinks I have seen have root:root ownership.&#160; I've never 
seen a situation where the ownership of the link itself has any bearing 
on whether the target location can be accessed.&#160; I'm not going to 
unilaterally claim that isn't possible, but I have never seen it.

Best practices do not change when there are symlinks involved, unless 
the software refuses to follow symlinks.&#160; Anything that would apply to a 
real file/directory would apply to the target of a symlink.&#160; My own best 
practices about private keys:&#160; They should only be readable by root and 
whatever user/group is active when software needs to use them.&#160; They 
should definitely not be writable by any user other than root.&#160; Some 
software starts as root to handle security stuff, then throws away the 
elevated permissions and runs as an unprivileged user.&#160; Apache httpd is 
a prime example of this.

You might be concerned that with 777 permissions, a symlink can be 
modified by anyone ... but I am about 98 percent sure that is not the 
case when proper permissions are used.&#160; I believe that a symlink can 
only be modified by a user that has write permission to the directory 
containing the symlink.

Properly implemented, symlinks do not reduce security, but any tool can 
be misused.&#160; If you have a situation where a symlink presents a security 
concern, it probably means someone did it wrong.

Thanks,
Shawn
