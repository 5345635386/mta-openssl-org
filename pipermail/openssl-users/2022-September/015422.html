What threat model requires you to obscure all traces of cleartext
metadata in the encrypted message?  In most common formats, in order to
facilitate algorithm agility, at least the encryption algorithm
identifier (often an ASN.1 OID) is included in the clear.

&gt;<i> In order for the encryption step to work by means of the public key,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A#) openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:16384 -keyout private.key -out public.key
</I>
This actually generates a self-signed X.509 certificate.  You can the
    
    -subj / -days 3650

options to set empty subject and issuer DNs and (given self-signed cert)
a 10-year or longer validity.  Use of RSA 16384 is ludicrous.  Anything
longer than 4096 bits is just posturing and even that is overkill,
once/if 2048-bit RSA is broken, the rest will surely follow in quick
succession...

&gt;<i> B#) openssl smime -encrypt -binary -aes-256-cbc -in message.txt -out encrypted.dat -outform DER public.key
</I>
In S/MIME (or its more modern incarnation as CMS) each recipient's
wrapped key carries a suitable recipient identifier:

    <A HREF="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5652#section-6.2">https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5652#section-6.2</A>

      KeyTransRecipientInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        version CMSVersion,  -- always set to 0 or 2
        rid RecipientIdentifier,
        keyEncryptionAlgorithm KeyEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier,
        encryptedKey EncryptedKey }

      RecipientIdentifier ::= CHOICE {
        issuerAndSerialNumber IssuerAndSerialNumber,
        subjectKeyIdentifier [0] SubjectKeyIdentifier }

If you want to use a key identifier instead of (issuerDN + serial), you
can use the &quot;-keyid&quot; option of the cms(1) command, having first made
sure that the certificate you generate carries a subject key identifier.

&gt;<i> I can get plain text injected into the encrypted text, which I want to
</I>&gt;<i> totally avoid every part of.
</I>
Your aversion to &quot;plaintext&quot; here looks poorly motivated.  It is just
CMS (S/MIME) recipient metadata.  CMS is not deniable encryption, the
outer layers of encapsulation are not encryption.

&gt;<i> How can I complete step A#), so that step B#)  will work, without involving a Certificate Request, which requires
</I>&gt;<i> a non-blank two digit nation code,
</I>
You can set an empty issuer/subject DN, or use &quot;-keyid&quot; to avoid copying
these into the CMS message.
