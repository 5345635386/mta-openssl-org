Not to second guess your finding that ssh isn't working well for you,
you know your own code best, but for my own interest, I'm curious what
about the fd is a problem? Perhaps the mismatch between X.509+TLS and
the auth model you want are enough to reconsider your abstractions?
Generating certs is pretty annoying and fragile, and using ssh clients
is pretty easy!

It sounds like your are building the abstractions (in C?) inside the
sernet process, but maybe your abstraction can be an fd, and the
&quot;layers&quot; can be child processes that connect fd-to-fd, sortof
qmail-like? Or, ssh should be able to execute an arbitrary command on
the server, and that command should be able to do anything it wants
with the ssh-facing socket descriptors, perhaps sending data to/from
your server which can then move the data through the in-process
abstractions?

Cheers,
Sam
