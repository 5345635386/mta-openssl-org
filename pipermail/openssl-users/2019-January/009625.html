We do not call abort(). A function like RAND_bytes() or
RAND_status() will just return an error.

RAND_bytes() has always documented that it can fail. Most function
calls can return errors for various reasons. Not checking for such
errors is in my opinion a bad style.

&gt;<i> i do not like that the stuff is instantiated in all threads
</I>
It's only created in each thread that tries to the RNG. I'm not
sure what exactly your problem with it is. Either we need a global
lock, or we need an RNG per thread. We went with the per thread
RNG.

We have a master DRBG that you can get with
RAND_DRBG_get0_master(). I recommend that you do not use it. It
requires that you take an external lock to use it. Internally we
lock it, but there is no way for you to use the same lock.

&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> in addition requires forks handlers to be installed all over the
</I>&gt;<i> place.
</I>
OpenSSL adds it's own fork handler now. You should not need to do
anything on fork related to OpenSSL.

&gt;<i> the Linux kernel that drives

</I>
Linux has a master pool, and a pool per core for the very same
reason as we also have a master DRBG and per thread DRBG.
