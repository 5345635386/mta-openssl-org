Hmmm. It's possible that it is still a client issue if the negotiated
extensions/ciphersuite/protocol version etc differ between the connection for
the old server and the new server. You might want to experiment with different
ciphersuite/group/sigalgs etc settings on the server to see if there is
sensitivity there to this issue.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ssl\statem\statem_lib.c:809 in function 'tls_process_finished' when the

</I>&gt;<i> corruption:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - client application bug
</I>&gt;<i> - server application bug
</I>&gt;<i> - client TLS library bug
</I>&gt;<i> - server TLS library bug
</I>&gt;<i> - network &quot;middlebox&quot; corruption
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd start by trying to isolate whether the problem is on the client side, the
</I>&gt;<i> server side, or the network. e.g. if the client is on the same host as the
</I>&gt;<i> server does the issue occur? Can you connect from a different client (different
</I>&gt;<i> application and/or different library or library version). Can the client connect
