</I>Well, that's what I meant :)&#160; And the self-signed certificates is what 
I've planned.&#160; If I used the default CA, then the user would have to get 
a certificate from someplace else, they couldn't generate it themselves.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Indeed, ssh is where I started, and I would love to use it.&#160; A custom 
client will be a pain, for sure, and I'd like to avoid it if possible.

But openssh only allows one connection per process, which is definitely 
not going to work with what I need.

libssh should be able to support multiple connections per process, but I 
spent about a week hacking on it, and the code is all wrapped around 
itself, not layered, and the changes to fix it would be huge.&#160; And I'm 
not going to support a fork of something that complex, and the 
maintainer didn't seem too keen on those types of changes.

I didn't find any other server libraries that were suitable.&#160; I'm not 
going to write my own ssh library.

Plus no ssh client will do serial port control over the network 
connection (like RFC2217), and many ser2net users use that.&#160; So I might 
have been stuck with a custom client, anyway.

I don't really like my options, but I'm kind of boxed in.&#160; I'm not sure 
why ssh doesn't run on top of ssl; that seems so sensible.&#160; I assume 
that's for historical reasons.

Thanks,
