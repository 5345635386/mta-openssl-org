OK, confirmed.  There was something in our code base that lead me to believe SSL_read() was returning the number of bytes consumed when processing handshake messages. I've just confirmed this is not the case and it always returns -1 during the handshake phase.

&gt;<i> If no application data is available then you get the
</I>&gt;<i> -1 (for SSL_read()) or 0 (for SSL_read_ex()) return code. You also get that
</I>&gt;<i> return code for other types of issues, and you are supposed to call
</I>&gt;<i> SSL_get_error() to interpret it.
</I>
In this case SSL_get_error() returns 2 (SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ) with either SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY on or /off.

&gt;<i> Note that by default OpenSSL sets SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY in 1.1.1 (which it didn't
</I>&gt;<i> in 1.1.0). This should mean that it automatically tries again to read
</I>&gt;<i> application data without returning an error. Have you switched
</I>&gt;<i> SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY off?
</I>
It was left at defaults for the initial tests.

&gt;&gt;<i> It seems to be that SSL_read() should return a positive integer representing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the number of bytes read from the BIO whilst processing the session tickets,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and SSL_read_ex should update readbytes to the number of bytes read from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BIO whilst processing the session tickets, as is done with other handshake
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is not correct. SSL_read()/SSL_read_ex() only ever provide the number of
</I>&gt;<i> application data bytes that have been read, irrespective of how many bytes were
</I>&gt;<i> read from the underlying BIO.
</I>
Would call BIO_pending() before/after the call to SSL_read() be the best way to determine the number of bytes consumed by SSL_read()?

We could use this to determine what SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ is indicating.  As it seems  SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ could indicate two conditions in this scenario:

1) No pending bytes - Additional handshake messages were processed, there's an expectation of additional application_data, but no hint that more application_data will be forthcoming.
2) Pending bytes - There is an incomplete record that needs processing.  Additional data should be fed into the BIO.
