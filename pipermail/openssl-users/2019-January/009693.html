Generating certs is easy if you do it like ssh does, and openssl is 
quite capable of that.

The auth model is not the issue, though.&#160; The problems I'm having are 
plugging
in to openssl in the right places to do what I want.&#160; But the help I've 
received
here has got me through that, I think.


&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> your server which can then move the data through the in-process
</I>&gt;<i> abstractions?
</I>
The model I have is something like openssl and the BIOs.&#160; You can plug 
different
things together in openssl any way you like.&#160; In each piece, you shove 
data in
one side and data comes out the other.&#160; You have BIOs at the end for dealing
with sockets or whatnot.&#160; So getting openssl running inside my framework
was quite easy.

Both openssh and libssh are not designed that way.&#160; There is no clean 
separation
between dealing with file descriptors (that's what I meant by fd) and 
the rest
of the library.&#160; And there were a number of other issues, too.

Thanks,
