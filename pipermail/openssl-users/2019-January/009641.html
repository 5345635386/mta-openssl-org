 |&quot;Just failing&quot; is precisely to allow you (and others) to do something

 |or doing a polite error reporting to the user.

I have to say i struggle with the OpenSSL project release
announcements.  Really.  I see a short mail which simply points
users to some (granted super duper) web site (with custom fonts
and such -- it must look fantastic on such a tablet thing that
i do not own!), and on these pages, which i, unfortunately and
until now, over and over again look at, ... to see nothing.

I mean, OpenSSL is such a vivid part of the infrastructure, top
that with security, of the world, it is used a billion of times
each and every day, and how many people really now about the
details inside this library with the terrible interface names (a
few minutes ago i discovered the also new ADMISSIONS.pod
documentation, and this is a statement for a language with
namespaces and method-on-object not instance-on-function; i always
think by myself that some university should perform neurological
science on what looking at

  const STACK_OF(ADMISSIONS) *ADMISSION_SYNTAX_get0_contentsOfAdmissions(const ADMISSION_SYNTAX *as);

from 9 to 5 (or 14 to 04 or whatever)/365-52 actually causes, how
do you say that in english?, what damages to the brain it causes,
anyway.)

The thing is, i have just seen the release candidate announcement
for bash 5.0 a while ago, and know what my own release message
will (have to) look like.

I did know nothing of all that.

 |||&gt; I think i will move away from RAND_ then, nonetheless, and at
 |||&gt; least for the things i have control of.
 |||
 |||I don't think this is a good idea. In the case when there is no suitable \

 |||entropy
 |||source, the OpenSSL RNG will fail to generate random bytes, indeed.
 |||But how do you expect your application to seed the RNG properly in this
 |||case? What is your application's entropy source? If you have one, which
 |
 ||Yes, that is the problem.  We do have several possibilities for
 ||VAL_RANDOM.  Some of them only seed our builtin ARC4
 ||implementation, which until now exposes the internal buffer as
 ...
 ||randomizing those weakly through the well-known algorithm from
 ||&quot;Random number generators: good ones are hard to find&quot;, Park and
 ||Miller, Communications of the ACM, vol. 31, no. 10, October 1988,
 ||p. 1195 (a_aux_rand_weak()).  This is the code:
 ...
 |Note that since that ancient article, ARC4 was not only invented, 
 |but also found too insecure for modern use.

I seem to know that for things like save transport.
I have for example suppressed adding the 

   for(u.i = 5 * sizeof(a_aux_rand-&gt;b8); u.i != 0; --u.i)
      a_aux_rand_get8();

which follows the unscientific seeding.  (And which likely is also
unscientific given that we have been seeded with random data
rather than with key/nonce ... whatever.)

 |Enjoy

Not really!  For example i read

  The reseeding default values are applied only during creation of
  a DRBG instance.  To ensure that they are applied to the global
  and thread-local DRBG instances (&lt;master&gt;, resp. &lt;public&gt; and
  &lt;private&gt;), it is necessary to call
  RAND_DRBG_set_reseed_defaults() before creating any thread and
  before calling any cryptographic routines that obtain random
  data directly or indirectly.

Does this give me at least the promise that OPENSSL_init_ssl() can
be called without rendering RAND_DRBG_set_reseed_defaults(0,0,0,0)
effectively a useless call?
I see that said function may return error, but it seems that the
MAX_RESEED_INTERVAL it fails to accept is not a public variable!
I tend to do the much more expensive dance with
RAND_DRBG_get0_public() and RAND_DRBG_get0_master() and
individually applying RAND_DRBG_set_reseed_time_interval() as well
as RAND_DRBG_set_reseed_interval() on each of them.
Is this even allowed without calling OPENSSL_init_ssl() first?
