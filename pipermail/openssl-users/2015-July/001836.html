</I>
Well I think what your saying is that we should play well with other
people's tools! My tools (and presumably the rest of the dev team's as
well) don't report this warning. Collectively the dev team expect a
build to work with --strict-warnings which means that there should be no
warnings reported at all for the team. That's quite a high bar to reach
because we've all got slightly different set ups, so every now and then
we encounter a problem that one person on the team gets but others
don't. No matter how high we set the bar though there is always going to
be some system somewhere that still reports a warning. We are never
going to be able to eradicate that.

I get your point about the time people spend on looking at a warning
adding up (although somehow I just don't buy the idea that 10,000 people
are going to spend 15 minutes each looking at it). I'm not arguing that
we shouldn't fix warnings when we become aware of them - particularly if
we think there is a real problem or the warning is coming from a common
tool chain. I'm just saying that pro-actively tracking them down so that
it always cleanly compiles with no warnings for everyone is not likely
to be a useful use of time (and is actually not realistic anyway).
