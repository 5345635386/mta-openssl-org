This is a good point. You are saying &quot;trust the developers, they know
what is best.&quot; I'm fine with that because they really do know what's
best. No one knows the code better.

... Then C&amp;A creeps in. For some companies, they have to acceptance
test libraries before using them. Its a matter of governance, polices
and procedures. If an organization's bar is lower than OpenSSL's, then
everything is fine. If the bar is higher, then its a pain pint.

Folks like Rich Salz knows exactly what I am talking about and
experiences the pain points regularly. (I've worn Rich's hat and
walked in his shoes).

&gt;<i> We could spend a huge amount of time tracking all of those down for
</I>&gt;<i> little benefit.
</I>
To play devil's advocate, To Whom? If 10,000 people each spend 15
minutes looking at (and re-analyzing) one warning, then the community
collectively lost 4,000 man hours. 2 minutes for a dev to clear the
issue once versus 4,000 man hours seems like a very good return on
investment.

And to be fair, I just cleared a similar warning in Crypto++:
<A HREF="https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/commit/d04b813e8b078e717992b86b8b6103db0bd2cec3.">https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/commit/d04b813e8b078e717992b86b8b6103db0bd2cec3.</A>
I new damn well all those variables were initialized, and the problem
was with analyzer's inter-procedural analysis.

For the d04b813e8 commit, I had to analyze it to ensure it was not a
legitimate squawk. But my choices after analyzing it were: (1) spend
30 seconds on the clear-commit-push cycle; or (2) allow the community
to spend countless hours reanalyzing it, and spend countless hours
explaining the reason for the dirty compile on the mailing list
(q.v.!). I opted for (1) because it was easier on me, and
organizations don't have to worry about C&amp;A and governance issues.

Like I said, its learning to play well with your tools :)
