<PRE>Thank you, Kurt.  The information I was getting (from some sources) was that
the vulnerability was only present in configurations where the server was
authenticating a client certificate.  The fact is, the vulnerability applies
to certificate validation regardless of if it's on the client or server
side.

I'm going to assume what those sources were probably augmenting their
assessment with their own risk analysis and decided that the only place the
risk exists (not vulnerability) is in clients presenting forged certificates
in situations where client auth is implemented.  That would make sense (like
you said) if we're talking about https, because basically no browsers are
implemented using OpenSSL, so presenting a forged server cert to a client is
basically a scenario that will not happen.  But it could happen for other
apps that use OpenSSL in their comm stack, even if they are only using
server authentication.

Thanks again,

It's whenever a certificate is received (and validated).  This means either:
- A client is authenticating a server (server authentication)
- A server is authenticating a client (client authentication)

Of course both could be happening for the same connection.

It's much more common that the client authenticates the server.
Certainly for https client authentication is uncommon.  Also, for https the
client ussually isn't OpenSSL based, except for android.
