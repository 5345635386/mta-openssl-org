<PRE>Good Day!

I am trying to build openssl-3.2.1 for an AlphaServer 4100 running Tru64 5.1b-6 as part of a side project that I am working on.  I noticed that Tru64 is still in the list of build combos.
I issued the following command:
./config tru64-alpha-cc
No errors, everything went fine.

Next I issued make.  After a while, an error is encountered [section A] noted below.  I think the interesting part is -&gt; ar: Error: crypto/bn/libcrypto-lib-alpha-mont.o cannot open &lt;-  I can confirm that this is file is not present anywhere on the server, but the .S is.

Out of curiosity, I tried openssl-1.1.1w, it fails for the same reason, but the path and error are slightly different.  

My second attempt was including the no-asm flag.  While I couldn&#8217;t find any direct results for the problem I was having, my Google searches kept return results that mentioned this as a workaround for similar-ish problem.  After running make, it eventually died complaining about a .so :  see below [section B].

Third attempt was with both the -no-asm and -no-shared flags, this too was not successful : [section C].

After a bit more reading and web-searching&#8230; I also tried ./config -shared -thread tru64-alpha-cc before issuing make. [section D].

Alpha is a dead architecture, but I thought I would at least reach out to see if someone with more knowledge than myself might be able to see the problem and know if it&#8217;s something relatively easy to fix or work around. 

I have gcc 4.4.7 and 4.7.4 available if you think that would have better luck.  I can live with the performance penalty of gcc compiled code on Alpha but would prefer to avoid it.  I am using GNU make. I completely removed the source tree and re-extracted between each attempt.

I did see the line in the notes about setting -rpath but I am unsure if this is my problem and if it is, what I should set. 

Thanks for whatever help you can provide.
