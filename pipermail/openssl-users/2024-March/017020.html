&gt;<i> Date: Mon, 04 Mar 2024 22:22:36 -0800
</I>&gt;<i> From: Hal Murray &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">halmurray+openssl at sonic.net</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Context is the chicken and egg problem of using TLS before a system knows the
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I work on NTP software.  NTP uses NTS (Network Time Security) which uses TLS
</I>&gt;<i> to make sure it is talking to the right servers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to figure out how to get started on a system that doesn't know the
</I>&gt;<i> time yet.  (Many low cost systems like the Raspberry Pi don't have a battery
</I>&gt;<i> backed clock.)
</I>
Someone please correct me if I'm getting something wrong, but my memory 
of this topic's history is as follows:

1. NTP implements &quot;v3&quot; crypto (symmetric keys), which works OK to this 
day *if* you can handle the roll-out of (&lt;64k different) shared keys.

2. NTP releases &quot;v4&quot; crypto (autokey? Not sure anymore), which gets 
broken on short notice.

3. NTP releases &quot;v5&quot; crypto (I remember a crypto scheme &quot;inspired by 
cable TV encryption systems&quot; promising to have clients set themselves up 
automagically being one of its operation modes, never saw a HowTo that'd 
have permitted me to actually set up such a beast), which also gets 
broken a while later.

4. NTP announces that it'll wait and adopt/adapt the crypto standard now 
being developed for PTP (rather than making another attempt of its own), 
presumably getting the chicken and the egg slain for good.

5. PTP, *meant* to be communicating between switch port and server NIC 
(can you say &quot;physical security&quot;?), drags its feet on the crypto topic.

6. NTP adopts NTS, which uses TLS, and thus X.509 certificates with a 
validity period ... and doesn't address the well-known chicken-and-egg 
problem at all.

... all this to say that truly solving this problem is *very* hard, if 
not theoretically impossible. For practical purposes, I guess that 
shipping installation images / devices / ... with a rather *short*-lived 
CA cert (to bootstrap stuff, not only NTS but also an update mechanism 
having the CA cert replaced frequently) and hoping that No Key Material 
Will Ever Get Leaked&#8482; (and thoroughly wiped from your servers at its end 
of validity) is about the best you can do.

Kind regards,
