That I have done.  There is only the root certificate and the client certificate.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my server, I am checking the certificate serial number.  Is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessary and sufficient to ensure that the certificate is the one I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generated and not a fake?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No.  That largerly irrelevant, unless you also have a list of revoked
</I>&gt;<i> certificate serial numbers, or better yet, a definitive list of the
</I>&gt;<i> unrevoked ones, but this is only after the chain validation succeeds, to
</I>&gt;<i> weed out stale certificates that were lost or those that belonged to
</I>&gt;<i> terminated users.
</I>
i am planning to use the serial number to handle revoked certificates.  I don't have that setup completely yet, but it is the next item on the agenda.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In other words the certificate validation just shows that the client
</I>&gt;<i> knows some secret associated with some user and not marked at the time
</I>&gt;<i> for expiration prior to now.  Meanwhile, the user may have moved on, the
</I>&gt;<i> private key may have been lost, ... so you still need to maintain a
</I>&gt;<i> table of which certs are not lost and still correspond to real users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems that it might be possible to create a CA that is certified
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by one of the known root certificates and use it to generate a client
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certificate with the identical issuer information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Correct, a server what wants to consume client certs needs to not trust
</I>&gt;<i> the usual WebPKI roots.  Instead, you'll need to trust *only* your own CA.
</I>&gt;<i> Set up the trust store for the server's SSL_CTX accordingly.
</I>
Now that I hadn't thought about.  it makes sense.  I'll have to see about how to do that.  i recall seeing some examples so it shouldn't be that difficult.  I have to make sure that the server will present it's public certificate that is derived from Lets Encrypt while validating on just my root certificate.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Obtaining the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proper issuer serial number would take some work, but I suspect it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible.  The rest of that information is trivial.  Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Serial numbers are not an authentication mechanism, they are however
</I>&gt;<i> a way of purging stable authenticators.
</I>
Thanks so much Viktor.  This has been a real help, and eye opener.
