</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and the app is heavily multi-threaded so I'm glad OpenSSL

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But because engines are initialised recursively, the locking

</I>&gt;<i> before 1.1.x.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively I could lazy-initialise engine2 in certificate callback

</I>&gt;<i> `engine1-&gt;init` I know a lock is already held so I thought it's safer

</I>&gt;<i> directly but through a layer of application logic so conceptually 
</I>&gt;<i> these two engines are orthogonal and know nothing about each other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess initialising engines recursively does not work in OpenSSL 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.1.x (it'd be a dead-lock) and I need to seek for a different place 
</I>&gt;<i> to initialise engine2, for example in certificate cb?  This would mean 
</I>&gt;<i> I &quot;leak&quot; some knowledge of engine2 existence into engine1, have 
</I>&gt;<i> guarantee that crypto engine lock is not held in certificate callabck 
</I>&gt;<i> function and need another lock to protect access to engine2 handle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know what your views are and if the above makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I am not part of the OpenSSL team and have no idea what their
thinking or suggestions are.

However the following should be a generic workaround:

1. Create a third engine3 which loads both engine1 and engine2
   internally (without going through OpenSSL and its locks).
   So for example engine3-&gt;init calls both engine2-&gt;init and
   engine1-&gt;init.

2. engine3 would export/provide all the methods from engine1
   and engine2 by forwarding or reexporting the calls.

3. OpenSSL itself is instructed to use only your engine3
   wrapper.

4. As a more ambitious project, someone could write a generic
   &quot;engine3&quot; which loads a list of actual engines from a config
   file.

At the OpenSSL design level, the OpenSSL team might extend the
OPENSSL_SSL_CLIENT_ENGINE_AUTOvariable to accept a
colon-separatedlist of engines rather than just a single engine.


Enjoy
