<PRE>To whom it may concern,

I have been experiencing issues with OpenSSL and DraginoYun. If you are not
the person I should have contacted, please redirect me. Thank you!

Recently, I have tried using OpenSSL to establish a simple server
application on Dragino Yun version 2.4. First, I tested the code on my Acer
Aspire 5750ZG running Ubuntu 14.04 and it worked fine. Afterwards, I used
OpenWrt SDK to cross-compile the application. However, the application is
unable to bind the socket; the BIO_do_accept function fails. Here is the
error stack the code provided:
&quot;2006783048:error:0200407C:lib(2):func(4):reason(124):NA:0:port='5354'
2006783048:error:20069076:lib(32):func(105):reason(118):NA:0:&quot;

errstr returned these as answers:
&quot;$ openssl errstr 0200407C
error:0200407C:system library:socket:Wrong medium type
$ openssl errstr 20069076
error:20069076:BIO routines:BIO_get_accept_socket:unable to create socket
&quot;
I suppose that the second one is a product of the first one.

I have checked iptables and I have checked ports that are currently in use,
all seems to be in order.

However, the OpenSSL s_server (in combination with s_client on the other
side) works fine.
May this be an OpenSSL bug? If not, do you have any suggestions?

OpenSSL version on Acer is 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014 and on Dragino 1.0.1h 5 Jun
2014.

In the attachment, I am providing the code(though I am not sure if it is
available on the list), mostly taken from O'Reilly &quot;Network Security with
OpenSSL&quot;.

All the passkeys are &quot;raspberry&quot;. (these certificates and keys were
generated for testing purposes)

Of course, should you need any additional information, I'd be happy to
provide it.

I originally addressed Matt Caswell regarding the issue and I am pasting
his response to my question and my response to that.

His response:
&quot;Hello,

I'm not really the best person to ask about such low level stuff. The
best place to raise these questions is on the openssl-users email list.
It also means any questions/answers are publicly archived and available
for other users. Details are here:

<A HREF="../../../index.html">https://mta.openssl.org</A>

However, I did have a quick look and discovered the following. The code
that raises this error looks like this:

    s = socket(server.sa.sa_family, SOCK_STREAM, SOCKET_PROTOCOL);
    if (s == INVALID_SOCKET) {
        SYSerr(SYS_F_SOCKET, get_last_socket_error());
        ERR_add_error_data(3, &quot;port='&quot;, host, &quot;'&quot;);
        BIOerr(BIO_F_BIO_GET_ACCEPT_SOCKET, BIO_R_UNABLE_TO_CREATE_SOCKET);
        goto err;
    }

So this is a call to the non-OpenSSL networking function &quot;socket&quot;. In
this context &quot;server.sa.sa_family&quot; has been set to AF_INET a few lines
above, and &quot;SOCKET_PROTOCOL&quot; is a macro defined at the beginning of the
file as follows:

# define SOCKET_PROTOCOL IPPROTO_TCP

In other words the function that is failing is doing this:

socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP)

This seems like a fairly fundamental failure, and might suggest that the
platform in question has no TCP/IP support available for some reason?&quot;

My response to his:
&quot;
Hi Matt,

The platform supports TCP/IP, if I deduced correctly. I have programmed an
application similar to the example in Unix Network Programming (a basic
TCP/IP echo server) and it works without any issues. Also, openssl s_server
works correctly; I tried using it with openssl s_client on the other
machine.
I will forward my question to the email list, including both of our
responses.
I am grateful for your quick response.

Best regards,
Nikola Milev

&quot;

My original mail to him is almost the same as the first part of this mail.

I am thankful for you support!

Best regards,
Nikola Milev
