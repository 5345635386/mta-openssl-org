<PRE>&gt;<i> After
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         ./configure ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm prompted
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Since you've disabled or enabled at least one algorithm, you need to
</I>&gt;<i> do
</I>&gt;<i>         the following before building:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 make depend
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exec'ing the 'make depend' stage returns lots of warnings,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ....
</I>
I'm not sure what's going on here. A lot has changed recently, and
something could have been knocked loose.

&gt;<i> Reading wiki &amp; reports at openssl, there's confusing, if not conflicting,
</I>&gt;<i> advice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OK, so the issue here is... Painting with a broad brush, there are
three OpenSSL distros - 1.0.1, 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 (and even 0.9.8). There
are also two build systems - the classic one from 1.0.1/1.0.2 (and
even 0.9.8) and the new unified one from 1.1.0.

Our task is to come up with one rule that &quot;just works&quot; everywhere to
teach users. We want &quot;one rule to rule them all&quot; because its easiest
on users. We don't want multiple rules. Its the reason 1.1.0 accepts a
config of &quot;./config no-ssl2 ...&quot; even though SSLv2 has been removed.
Its the rule we've been pounding into people's head's.

The rule I've been following/practicing is the following. I do it
regardless of whether I am prompted or not (because I like one simple
rule to follow):

     make depend &amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp; make

    - 'make depend' gets the dependencies right
    - 'make clean' gets rid of old/dated artifacts (with dependencies
accounted for)
    - 'make' builds under a &quot;good&quot; state (since depend and clean have executed)

************

Regarding this from the wiki:

    After configuring the library, you should run make. If prompted,
    there's usually no need to make depend since you are building
    from a clean download.&quot;

We should probably remove that statement and replace it with the one
rule. Sadly, I'm probably the guy who put it there. I'll get that
fixed later today.

************

If I can ask.... as a user, if I say do this _all the time_, then
would it be easiest on you?

    make depend &amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp; make

Or is there something else you would recommend?

************

As far as not configuring because stddef.h, that sounds like a bug.
