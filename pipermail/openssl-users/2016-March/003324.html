To a rough first approximation this is true for object code, but the
story is a little more nuanced for the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module. We
create that in a way (the &quot;monolithic&quot; object module) that prevents the
application link process from scrambling what would otherwise have been
an assortment of object modules (in the software engineering sense, not
FIPS-speak).

The premain (native compilation) process, the &quot;incore&quot; utilities
(cross-compilation), and the run-time POST integrity test all calculate
exactly the same digest over exactly the same bits (in our case, the
TEXT and RODATA segments). If the application link process rearranged
any of that TEXT or RODATA then the runtime integrity test would fail.

So very technically speaking the FIPS module is not fipscanister.o, but
the TEXT and RODATA data within it.

To use your analogy, the fipscanister.o &quot;can&quot; contains only one tomato
which is an indigestible and indivisible blob that appears intact in the
baked quiche. Bon App?tit..

You miss the point. It is no more or less critical that 'the application 
link to the intended crypto module' than countless other things. Many of 
the other things cannot be checked by running a tool. How would a tool 
check that the vendor had executed 'make' at the appropriate stage as 
opposed to (say) '/usr/bin/make'? How would a tool check that the vendor 
had got the original tar file from the OSF CD rather than by downloading it?

</I>
How can it come down to anything else? What other possible means are 
there for a customer to know that an OpenSSL-based product is FIPS 140-2 
validated?

Steve,

How does one get a hold of the embedded signature in libcrypto.so ? 

Thanks

Ummm, because the vendor is the one who created the validated module.
Only that vendor can know for sure how the module was created, because the FIPS 140-2 requirements have non-technical procedural elements (think of those as ideological or spiritual elements).

Note that in this context &quot;vendor&quot; refers to the entity that created the validated module and submitted it for FIPS 140-2 validation. The company that uses the FIPS module in their product is a &quot;user&quot;, not a &quot;vendor&quot;, with respect to the validated module.

But it necessarily always comes down to a vendor document, for *any* validated module, not just the OpenSSL FIPS module.. I've tried and failed now several times to articulate why that is so and can't think of any new way to present it, but it is simply not possible to do what you want; there is no such thing as a magical pixie dust detector. We cannot make one; no one can.

There isn't necessarily any embedded signature in a shared object.  In many
cases, there won't be one.  If your shared object was built with a new
enough version of GCC, hasn't been fully stripped, and its note section has
not been removed during the build process, you can get a SHA-1 checksum
from the binary like this:
<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">michael at osiris</A>:~$ readelf -n /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so

Displaying notes found at file offset 0x000001c8 with length 0x00000024:
  Owner                 Data size Description
  GNU                  0x00000014 NT_GNU_BUILD_ID (unique build ID
bitstring)
    Build ID: 1e5fca06588d1d7c0f8f4b16c82611e6be697fb2

The GNU linker generates this value, but for the details of how it is
calculated you'd probably have to refer to the gcc source code.  Depending
on what is being hashed, you may or may not be able to re-calculate that
value at a later time.

Caveat emptor: the build id was likely not designed to prove that the
executable code is unmodified.  Its stated goal is to identify repeatable
builds on the same host with the same tools.

&quot;As long as politics is the shadow cast on society by big business, the
attenuation of the shadow will not change the substance.&quot;
