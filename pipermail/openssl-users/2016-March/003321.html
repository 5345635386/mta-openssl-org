By remembering whether or not he followed the required procedure; it's 
the only way for him to know.

You miss the point. It is no more or less critical that 'the application 
link to the intended crypto module' than countless other things. Many of 
the other things cannot be checked by running a tool. How would a tool 
check that the vendor had executed 'make' at the appropriate stage as 
opposed to (say) '/usr/bin/make'? How would a tool check that the vendor 
had got the original tar file from the OSF CD rather than by downloading it?

&gt;<i> This convoluted and complex object module linking etc. with 207 page user guide is specific to openssl's approach to FIPS, and therefore should be addressed by the project. It should not come down to some vendor document written in good faith.
</I>
How can it come down to anything else? What other possible means are 
there for a customer to know that an OpenSSL-based product is FIPS 140-2 
validated?
