If you only have one CRL in the the form &lt;hash&gt;.r0 then that will get loaded.
What may have happened in your case was that there were two CRLs with the
same issuer name and the hash file only pointed to the one which was not up to
date. So OpenSSL would only load that one case and you'd get that error.

If you had CRLs of the form .r0, .r1 etc then it should've loaded both and
used the more recent one.

When you have CRLs bundled in a file they all get loaded so it will see both
and use the appropriate case.
