The hash depends on the CRL issuer name only. It is first converted to a
canonical form and then a hash taken of the encoding. That guarantees that
identical issuer names will produce the same hash. Equivalent (i.e. equal but
not having the same encoding) issuer names *should* produce the same hash. The
hash is only 8 hex digits so there are only 2^32 possible hashes which gives a
1 in 2^16 chance of a collision: but you'd get a different error in that case.

</I>
If the CRLs are in a big file then the duplicate hash issue wont affect this.
What this might be is if you have two CRLs with identical issuer name one of
which has a nextUpdate after the current time (which is what causes the error)
and one before. In the case of the hashes in a directory calling everytyhing
.r0 only one CRL would be downloaded. In a big file the valid CRL would be
selected of the two.

A question back: is the CRL set fixed when you start the server or are you
trying to update them in real time?
