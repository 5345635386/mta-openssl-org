I think the keywords here are &#8220;as currently implemented&#8221;. I have no
problem accepting Viktor&#8217;s and your answers why *the current
implementation* behaves the way it does. But why is it not re-implemented
in a friendlier way?

&gt;<i>...
</I>&gt;<i>So while it might seem like verify *ought to* be idempotent, in fact it
</I>&gt;<i>represents a substantial transformation on the context which the existing
</I>&gt;<i>code cannot reverse. That doesn't actually strike me as all that strange,

</I>&gt;<i>verification, perform verification, clean up verification. I don't see
</I>&gt;<i>anything that implies the middle step wouldn't irreversibly change state.
</I>
Perhaps these three stages could/should be wrapped into a single API that
*internally* does these three steps? Especially since it does not look
like any of those steps can be re-used on its own?

As for &#8220;nothing implies...&quot; - usually people assume that operations like
&#8220;read&#8221;, &#8220;verify&#8221; (unlike &#8220;write&#8221;, &#8220;set&#8221;), do not change the state of the
object involved. 

If I ask &#8220;if your passport valid&#8221;, I expect to be able to repeat this
question and (as long as this all is within a reasonably short time) get
exactly the same answer.

Although once the current state of the API is explained, I&#8217;m happy enough
to just use all the three steps if/when cert verification is needed.
Documentation seems reasonably clear:

The negative return value from X509_verify_cert() can only occur if no
certificate is set in ctx (due to a programming error); if
X509_verify_cert() twice without reinitialising ctx in between; or if a
retry operation is requested during internal lookups (which never happens
with standard lookup methods). It is however recommended that application
check for &lt;= 0 return value on error.


But reference (URL) to &#8220;verify&#8221; page
(<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/crypto/verify.html">https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/crypto/verify.html</A>) is broken:

The requested URL /docs/manmaster/crypto/verify.html was not found on this
