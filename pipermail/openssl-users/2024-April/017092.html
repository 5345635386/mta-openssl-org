</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> but then it is necessary to either abort the handshake on the import

</I>&gt;<i> See X509_STORE_CTX_set_error(3), but tread cautiously, there be dragons.
</I>
Thanks for that explanation.  That would probably be helpful to others if it was included somewhere in the openssl documentation.

It should be a fairly new s_client.  The client I used for that testing, and for the server is FreeBSD 14.0.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, if I use one of the various clients to make the same request,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the results are quite different.  There are a number of connections
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> made that fail and then finally they make the proper connection and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everything works.  The time it takes to get through all of that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quite long - around 5 seconds.  The server is recording the following
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> errors from SSL_accept:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Connection 1 - session id context uninitialized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Connection 2 - session id context uninitialized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Connection 3 - sslv3 alert certificate unknown
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Connection 4 - sslv3 alert certificate unknown
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Who's sending/receiving the alerts?  The server would typically report
</I>&gt;<i> *received* alerts, and it is then perhaps the client that is failing to
</I>&gt;<i> validate the server certificate, but without a clear context, it is
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to say what happened.
</I>
All of the logging is on the server side.  I don't really have any ability to do anything with the clients.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for session id contexts, your server code needs to set one in order
</I>&gt;<i> to support resumption properly, one more difference between s_client
</I>&gt;<i> and other clients, is that s_client always starts with no saved
</I>&gt;<i> sessions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Postfix SMTP server has:

</I>
I'll have to do that then.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and then Connection 5 sees the proper client certificate, authenticates and produces output.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps the client is no longer attempting resumption?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How can I figure out what is causing these multiple connections and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the resulting errors.  I have tcpdump and ssldump output but nothing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there gives me any ideas.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The ssldump software is abandoned, use &quot;tcpdump&quot; + &quot;&quot;tshark&quot;, as explained in:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="https://marc.info/?l=postfix-users&amp;m=166005488423800&amp;w=2">https://marc.info/?l=postfix-users&amp;m=166005488423800&amp;w=2</A>
</I>
Thanks.   I have tdump available but had not figured out how to use it.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can provide either of those if needed, but they are large.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With &quot;tcpdump&quot;, after capturing a bunch of traffic, you extract just a
</I>&gt;<i> particular connection of interest, details in the post linked above.
</I>&gt;<i> You can then analyse it with &quot;tshark&quot; (same link).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately I have not figured out how to get ssldump to decode the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application data.  As best as I can tell, the negotiated cipher cannot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be handled by ssldump.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Delete &quot;ssldump&quot; you're better off without it.
</I>
So I see.  It's going away after I send this.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The clients each have the same 2 client certificates.  They ask which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one to use, but perhaps they are trying both?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A given handshake can only try one client certificate as part of the
</I>&gt;<i> normal handshake.  THere's also post-handshake authenticaiton (PHA) in
</I>&gt;<i> TLS 1.3, but you probably don't have server code for that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That the clients are putting up a dialogue does strengthen the
</I>&gt;<i> plausibility of the server's client certificate request being part of
</I>&gt;<i> the problem.  You may need to carefully tune your server's list of
</I>&gt;<i> solicited client CAs.  See the docs for SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(3).
</I>&gt;<i> Less is more (ideally just one if there's only one CA issuing the
</I>&gt;<i> desired certificates).
</I>
I only have my root certificate in the chain for authentication.  Your last response to me made that point loud and clear.  Thanks.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And finally, but importantly, what exactly is your use case?  How does
</I>&gt;<i> the server expect to benefit from (make access and authorisation
</I>&gt;<i> decisions based on) client certificates?
</I>
The case is an organization that was initially using passwords for authentication.  That worked properly and was easy to setup.  However, in the process of doing that I discovered that all their users had the name of the company as their password.  Given that the loss of the information that needs to be protected would be a very significant financial loss to the company, that approach is really not a good idea.  I proposed the certificate authentication and management agreed.
