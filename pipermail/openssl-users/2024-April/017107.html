Thanks, the below is much more clear/actionable.

&gt;<i> Apr 18 16:15:17 &lt;3.7&gt; RIB wncert[20518]: SSL Error: Accept failed -
</I>&gt;<i> 0020A163511D0000:error:0A000416:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:
</I>&gt;<i> sslv3 alert certificate unknown:/usr/src/crypto/openssl/ssl/record/rec_layer_s3.c:1586:
</I>&gt;<i> SSL alert number 46
</I>
This is a client-to-server alert, initiated by the remote client, to
indicate that the client does not like something about server's
certificate.

If the server certificate chain is complete (not missing required
intermediate certs), unexpired and issued by a trust-anchor that should
be present on the client, then perhaps the client is actually unhappy
with the CAs in the certificate request, though that seems less likely.

&gt;<i> These 6 connection attempts occurred prior to the user selecting the
</I>&gt;<i> proper certificate to use.  Once that was done, there was only on
</I>&gt;<i> additional connection and it was successful.  No error returns and the
</I>&gt;<i> server returned the proper response.
</I>
Therefore, first ensure that clients should be able to validate your
server certificate chain.

&gt;<i> &gt; But what list of CAs is sent in the certificate request?  If it is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CA names from full default system trust store, that could be unhelpful,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as well as a security issue, since any of those CAs could impersonate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your clients.  For client authentication, Postfix only trusts client
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certificate or public key fingerprints, bypassing the CA trust quagmire,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that is typically unhelpful (and a major security risk) for client certs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure how to answer this.  I have set SSL_CTX_load_verify_dir
</I>&gt;<i> (ssl_ctx, &quot;/dev/null&quot;).  There is only my root certificate used to
</I>&gt;<i> generate the client certificates in SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations and
</I>&gt;<i> SSL_load_client_CA_file. 
</I>
Perhaps some clients don't like requests for certs from CAs they don't
know?

&gt;<i> My server cert (from letsencrypt) is set in
</I>&gt;<i> SSL_CTX_use_certificate_file along with it's key in
</I>&gt;<i> SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file.
</I>
Are you using &quot;cert.pem&quot; or &quot;fullchain.pem&quot;?  The former is not a
complete chain.

&gt;<i> &gt; Find a way to prevent password sharing, to check password quality, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DO NOT force periodic password rotation, which ensures users choose bad
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; passwords.  Then consider various second factor options, TOTP and HOTP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; perhaps, or SMS, ...  Some single-systems also include risk metrics,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to bypass second factors when things look &quot;normal&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a high intensity, time critical, environment.  Management
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't want time wasted trying find/remember passwords.  
</I>
That may be so, but client certificates for interactive use by humans
don't have a good usability track record.
