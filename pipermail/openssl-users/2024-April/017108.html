<PRE>Really off the wall idea - is it possible that the client is trying to establish a QUIC session?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To debug TLS 1.3, you probably want to enable handshake and error logging (info)
</I>&gt;<i> callbacks on the server, and not abbreviate the reported errors to such
</I>&gt;<i> a degree that all context is lost.  It should be clear (to a trained
</I>&gt;<i> eye) from a reported SSL alert error, for example whether the alert was
</I>&gt;<i> a client to server or a server to client alert.  This means not
</I>&gt;<i> summarising the error messages, but reporting them in full.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> See X509_STORE_CTX_set_error(3), but tread cautiously, there be dragons.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for that explanation.  That would probably be helpful to others
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if it was included somewhere in the openssl documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I may look into it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Who's sending/receiving the alerts?  The server would typically report
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *received* alerts, and it is then perhaps the client that is failing to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> validate the server certificate, but without a clear context, it is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> difficult to say what happened.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All of the logging is on the server side.  I don't really have any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ability to do anything with the clients.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Post the relevant log entries verbatim, unsummarised.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  SSL_CTX_set_session_id_context(server_ctx,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>                                 (void *) &amp;server_session_id_context,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>                                 sizeof(server_session_id_context));
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'll have to do that then.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It may avoid some of the problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That the clients are putting up a dialogue does strengthen the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> plausibility of the server's client certificate request being part of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the problem.  You may need to carefully tune your server's list of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> solicited client CAs.  See the docs for SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(3).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Less is more (ideally just one if there's only one CA issuing the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> desired certificates).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I only have my root certificate in the chain for authentication.  Your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> last response to me made that point loud and clear.  Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But what list of CAs is sent in the certificate request?  If it is the
</I>&gt;<i> CA names from full default system trust store, that could be unhelpful,
</I>&gt;<i> as well as a security issue, since any of those CAs could impersonate
</I>&gt;<i> your clients.  For client authentication, Postfix only trusts client
</I>&gt;<i> certificate or public key fingerprints, bypassing the CA trust quagmire,
</I>&gt;<i> that is typically unhelpful (and a major security risk) for client certs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And finally, but importantly, what exactly is your use case?  How does
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the server expect to benefit from (make access and authorisation
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decisions based on) client certificates?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The case is an organization that was initially using passwords for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authentication.  That worked properly and was easy to setup.  However,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the process of doing that I discovered that all their users had the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> name of the company as their password.  Given that the loss of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information that needs to be protected would be a very significant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> financial loss to the company, that approach is really not a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea.  I proposed the certificate authentication and management
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agreed.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this is for browser-based applications, you're probably fighting a
</I>&gt;<i> losing battle.  Client certificates just haven't worked at all well for
</I>&gt;<i> interactive use by most users.  They're fine for datacentre
</I>&gt;<i> machine-machine comms, and in some specialised orgs (like US DoD?) where
</I>&gt;<i> users have no choice, and presumably get adequate support to make it
</I>&gt;<i> work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Find a way to prevent password sharing, to check password quality, and
</I>&gt;<i> DO NOT force periodic password rotation, which ensures users choose bad
</I>&gt;<i> passwords.  Then consider various second factor options, TOTP and HOTP
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps, or SMS, ...  Some single-systems also include risk metrics,
</I>&gt;<i> to bypass second factors when things look &quot;normal&quot;.
