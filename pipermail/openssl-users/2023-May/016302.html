They're just informational.  They're neither the way to go, nor not the
way to go.  They're not an alternative to issuer certificate subject DNs
matching subject certificate issuer DNs, they're just something you can
decorate the certificate with, if your application can then benefit in
some way from having access to properly typed issuer names (signed by
a parent issuer, or self-signed if a trust-anchor).

&gt;<i> As I was falling asleep last night I thought that
</I>&gt;<i> authorityKeyIdentifier is part of the solution.
</I>
You can put directory names and serial numbers there, but not clear
what problem you're really trying to solve.

&gt;<i> issuerName is CN=20010030000000
</I>&gt;<i> authorityKeyIdentifier is iPAddress=20010030000000052aeb9adc1ce8b1ec
</I>
GeneralNames in the AKID specify the issuer's issuer (along with a
mandatory associated serial number), I've never seen anything other
than directory names used there, and other name types are likely to
not be supported.

Issuer names are just opaque blobs used to create links in the chain
from trust-anchor to end-entity certificate.  Just don't ascribe them
any meaning beyond making them somewhat human readable, so operators
will be able to tell them apart.

All that matters in the end is that the EE certificate chains up to
the trust anchor via a series of zero or more intermediate (a.k.a.
subsidiary) issuer certificates.

The name of the EE certificate is meaningful and should be a SAN.
The issuer CA and TA names are opaque chain node ids.
