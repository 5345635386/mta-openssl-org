<PRE>this is the first time in decades I have been doing serious PKi design,,,

I am now looking at the various certificates, each with different 
keypairs that the CA uses.

It has its base authorization-to-exist cert that SHOULD rarely be used 
other than to sign its other certs.

It has a signing cert for signing the certs of all of its subscribers.
It has a CRL signing cert, well for signing any CRLs it generates.
It may have an OSCP signing cert.
...

The question is what to use for subjectName for all of these?&#160; What is 
the &quot;common&quot; practice.&#160; I have been googling and reading docs all 
morning and not finding anything on this subject.

Is the practice to use a lower OU level for these certs below the CA's 
base cert?
Are they all named the same (unique_subject=no) with only the 
subjectKeyIdentifier different and the CA operator 'knowing' which to 
use where, but not (necessarily) outsiders to the CA?

Duplicate subjectName, but something like a policy OID to identify which 
is for what?

My search foo is weak, and I have to run off to a dr appt and I really 
want to get this part settled today.

Sigh.&#160; It is always one more hurdle.

thanks for any pointers.&#160; I am just not finding something to read that 
gives guidance on best practices for this.
