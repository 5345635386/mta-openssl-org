<PRE>&gt;<i>From memory, the root signing certificate is a self signed certificate and
</I>is used as the root of trust for any PKI. The root ca server (RA) should
never go online and it's purpose is to issue signing certificates for
Intermediate Certificate Authorities. These ICAs are used to issue
certificates for a variety of purposes including TLS encryption and
identification. Many years ago, the Subject of a certificate used for TLS
held the FQDN for the associated server. Some older browsers may still
expect this behavior. Today the Subject Alternate Name (SAN) attribute in a
certificate is much more critical than the Subject name. Distinguished Name
is always (as far as I know) a structured value and is used to determine
identification of the entity the certificate is issued to.  The uniqueness
of a certificate is based on ICA + Serial Number.

A good starting point to read about x509 certificates is

If you intend to create your own private PKI service, you will need to add
the certificate authority hierarchy (RA and ICAs) to the devices that need
to trust that certificate. Even after doing that, there may be some
browsers that do not automatically trust a new root CA added to the
system's certificate store.
