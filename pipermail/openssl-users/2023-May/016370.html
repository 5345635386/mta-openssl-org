My hope would be that we wouldn't *need* to separate them, that we could
just have one list.&#160; But maybe I'm spending more effort attempting to
achieve that simplification than it's worth.

Mostly I am not *too* concerned about usability here.&#160; I regard this as
an escape hatch. 98% of the time the defaults we supply will be fine.&#160;
1% of the time it will be necessary to loosen them for interoperability
with older equipment.&#160; 1% of the time it will be necessary to tighten
them to disallow some compromised algorithm, or for some policy reason.&#160;
These are not personal preference items where users can be expected to
select random combinations and expect them to work - my only goal there
is that selecting a bad combination must not fail stupidly.

Other than intellectual curiosity as to why a single unified list is a
bad idea, I think I've gotten the answer I needed:&#160; the fact that the
&quot;ciphersuites&quot; functions accept and process TLS 1.2 ciphers is an
accident that we should not rely on.
