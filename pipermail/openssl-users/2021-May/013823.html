<PRE>This is at my house in my basement.   My Fortinet 60E firewall is kept on the latest software.   I am waiting now for 7.0.1 or 7.0.2 to be released.   Fortinet engineers usually email me when to upgrade to the new revision.  I have 4 NFRs open on IPv6 and DHCPv6.    UTM is fully enabled.  Geofencing is configured for many countries.   I keep the certificates up to date.      I spend time on The Hacker News looking at reporting bugs.   I actually ran Nessus on my servers and they came back clean.   SSL Labs reports on my web site configurations.   I started learning more about cryptology.    The OpenSSL bugs state to upgrade beyond 1.1.1f.

</I>&gt;<i> My wordpress servers are under constant attack.  My Fortinet 60E firewall logs are filled.  Openssl is constantly reported on The Hacker News and other sites.   So I don&#8217;t need to worry about upgrading OpenSSL in the future to 1.1.1k or above?   I can just use what the distro has to offer by apt?  Ubuntu 20.04 started with 1.1.1f.    My Kali server is mainly used for Try Hack Me challenges and learn cyber security.

</I>      Security is a series of compromises based on understanding your needs and defense in depth. For instance, do you run something like fail2ban? Do you monitor your logs and network traffic?

</I>&gt;<i> My biggest compliant with Linux is it is so difficult to get best practice installations for services like OpenSSL.   Ubuntu is still on 1.1.1f.    I have been trying to upgrade to 1.1.1k.   Openssl version -a states I am on 1.1.1k.   When programs in Wordpress that use OpenSSL show I am using 1.1.1.f.   Spending hours of time on various sites like AskUbuntu.com, only to be disappointed.   Microsoft has best practices guides for installations.   Why can&#8217;t we get them for Linux.

</I>&gt;<i> this is both very hard and undesirable:
</I>&gt;<i> openssl can be regarded as a low-level system library that is used by many applications across the entire Linux distribution. You cannot simply upgrade this low-level system library without breaking these applications. Admittedly, for an upgrade from 1.1.1f -&gt; 1.1.1k the risk of introducing an API change is quite low, but for anything else (e.g. 1.1.0x -&gt; 1.1.1k) you will almost certainly have to rebuild and relink all applications that depend on the OpenSSL libraries.
</I>&gt;<i> This is not something you can expect from the Linux distro maintainers. For them, it is far less risky to backport security fixes to the version of OpenSSL that they built their distro on (e.g. Ubuntu 20 &gt; 1.1.1f; CentOS 7 -&gt; 1.0.2k (yes!), etc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that most update woes that Windows 10 has had over the past few years were related to library updates breaking applications - so even microsoft has problems with &quot;best practices&quot;.
