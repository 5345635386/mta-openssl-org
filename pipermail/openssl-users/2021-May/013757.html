<PRE>Hi,

I have updated the openssl version running on the switch from 1.1.1g to
1.1.1h and eventually to 1.1.1k.
Starting 1.1.1h, I am observing that the switch hangs for a significant
amount of time (&gt; 3 minutes) when the call RAND_write_file is invoked from
the switch software.
The same call (RAND_write_file) invoked from the switch software with the
earlier versions of openssl (1.1.1g) did not make the switch to hang for
the noticeable time. Can you please help me understand why this behavior is
and suggest a solution if any?

Regards,
Sravani
