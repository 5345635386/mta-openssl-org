<PRE>If you use a supported distro (i.e., one that is not out of life) then
the distro is expected to supply CVE issue fixes in form of updates.
They usually do not upgrade the version to the upstream one but just
backport the security fixes and that's the reason why the version does
not change.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> this is both very hard and undesirable: 
</I>&gt;<i> openssl can be regarded as a low-level system library that is used by
</I>&gt;<i> many applications across the entire Linux distribution. You cannot
</I>&gt;<i> simply upgrade this low-level system library without breaking these
</I>&gt;<i> applications. Admittedly, for an upgrade from 1.1.1f -&gt; 1.1.1k the
</I>&gt;<i> risk of introducing an API change is quite low, but for anything else
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. 1.1.0x -&gt; 1.1.1k) you will almost certainly have to rebuild and
</I>&gt;<i> relink all applications that depend on the OpenSSL libraries. 
</I>&gt;<i> This is not something you can expect from the Linux distro
</I>&gt;<i> maintainers. For them, it is far less risky to backport security
</I>&gt;<i> fixes to the version of OpenSSL that they built their distro on (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> Ubuntu 20 &gt; 1.1.1f; CentOS 7 -&gt; 1.0.2k (yes!), etc).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that most update woes that Windows 10 has had over the past few

No matter how far down the wrong road you've gone, turn back.
