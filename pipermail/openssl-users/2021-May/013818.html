</I>this is both very hard and undesirable:
openssl can be regarded as a low-level system library that is used by 
many applications across the entire Linux distribution. You cannot 
simply upgrade this low-level system library without breaking these 
applications. Admittedly, for an upgrade from 1.1.1f -&gt; 1.1.1k the risk 
of introducing an API change is quite low, but for anything else (e.g. 
1.1.0x -&gt; 1.1.1k) you will almost certainly have to rebuild and relink 
all applications that depend on the OpenSSL libraries.
This is not something you can expect from the Linux distro maintainers. 
For them, it is far less risky to backport security fixes to the version 
of OpenSSL that they built their distro on (e.g. Ubuntu 20 &gt; 1.1.1f; 
CentOS 7 -&gt; 1.0.2k (yes!), etc).

Note that most update woes that Windows 10 has had over the past few 
years were related to library updates breaking applications - so even 
microsoft has problems with &quot;best practices&quot;.
