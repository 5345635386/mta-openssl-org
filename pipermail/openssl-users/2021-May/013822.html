<PRE>I follow the LTS Enablement Stack and LTS versions.   I am on 20.04.2.   I guess I wait for 22.04 next year.  

Your Hardware Enablement Stack (HWE) is supported until April 2025.

Subject: Re: Why can't we get a proper installation method to keep OpenSSL at the latest revision for Linux?

If you use a supported distro (i.e., one that is not out of life) then the distro is expected to supply CVE issue fixes in form of updates.
They usually do not upgrade the version to the upstream one but just backport the security fixes and that's the reason why the version does not change.
