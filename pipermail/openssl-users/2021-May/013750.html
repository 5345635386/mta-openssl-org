</I>&gt;<i>
</I>no actually, neither is the case. I submitted the work for payment, 
accounting inquired of the developer if it was all working and he stated 
it wasnt. So where it is, and its more i think we dont understand is 
when the client registers and is authorized it should generate a new xml 
config for the client, and right now there appears to be some mismatch, 
basically we have no idea how you had this working. so we are a month in 
from the work you did and i submitted payment for, and still have had 0 
reproducability. Ive even reviewed the document you sent, as has he, and 
we are missing something.

the database says

07:28:53',1,1)

the ac_server logs says..... so is it a mismatched certificate ?
