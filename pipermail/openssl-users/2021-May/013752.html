<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I was that second developer and even though 'Embedded Devel' listed

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the first time I hear of this. To get a few things straight 
</I>&gt;<i> (and I have the full email exchange at hand to back this up):
</I>
Wow so lets just make the whole thing public.

&gt;<i> - 'embedded devel' originally asked for a developer to port old 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL code to openssl 1.1+
</I>&gt;<i> - I offered to do this and ported the application to work with openssl 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.1.1 within a few hours. 'embedded devel' agreed with me in email 
</I>&gt;<i> that I had achieved the original goal.
</I>
This is in fact true, and i dont dispute it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - after that, I offered to help in debugging the rest of the 
</I>&gt;<i> client/server application workflow, which was poorly documented but 
</I>&gt;<i> which had little to do with openssl specifics. I never offered or 
</I>&gt;<i> promised to get the entire client/server application framework working 
</I>&gt;<i> again.
</I>&gt;<i> - 'embedded devel' accepted my offer and said he had a fixed maximum 
</I>&gt;<i> amount that he could spend.
</I>
Also true.

&gt;<i> - I worked for the remainder of the time on analyzing and debugging 
</I>&gt;<i> the application workflow, even though it turned out that I was not 
</I>&gt;<i> given all source code. 'embedded devel' confirmed that a part was missing.
</I>The missing part was the UI, which itself was also in the process of a 
rewrite, also of which isnt completed and the developer has been 
compensated already.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - I wrote a report with my findings and suggestions on how to proceed. 
</I>&gt;<i> 'embedded devel' was satisfied with the report and told me he would 
</I>&gt;<i> ask accounting to pay me.
</I>
I am and was satisfied, and I did submit it to billing. However that 
being said, we still cannot reproduce how you made this work because it 
is unclear, it doesnt apper clearly in the document, that also didnt 
prevent me from paying the bill.

&gt;<i> - after several reminders about payment he did not respond to my 
</I>&gt;<i> emails until I made my post yesterday, claiming for the first time 
</I>&gt;<i> that what I had done was not reproducible.
</I>
This is untrue, and heres the proof.

&quot;ive already processed this for payment, ill push the accountant to get 
it remitted

though the tone is a bit stern...&#160; nothing to worry about, itll post to 
you.

Thanks

Now so we can not consume everyone elses time with trivial bits of 
banter and this spins out of hand

emailing the list, and outing these facts doesnt get you paid either. It 
seems yopur just upset because you believe we are trying to rip you off 
and we arent. Plainly said it doesnt appear to work, we cannot reproduce 
it, however i know that when you did it, it did work, so whats the 
secret. To me its simple.

work is obviously done, more then happy to pay, matter of fact ill remit 
$500 Euros in good faith right now. Out of my personal account. Now 
proof of payment is sent, simply tell us how you made this work. And 
leave everyone else out of it, We are all busy, I did what i said i 
would do, and never intended not to pay you.

</I>
Personally, I would have used a different tone in your last 3 emails. 
Its not very professional. And I did submit the payment information, I 
even signed for it to be remitted. My Accountants have a process, they 
followed the process. Sometimes thing take time of get thrown a curve 
ball. And FYI, I am the Owner and CEO.
