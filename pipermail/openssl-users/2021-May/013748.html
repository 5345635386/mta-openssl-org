I was that second developer and even though 'Embedded Devel' listed this 
as &quot;paid&quot; work and even though he made repeated promises about following 
up on payment, I never did receive payment.

I checked the email address and IP addresses used for this job and found 
nothing terribly wrong. My conclusion is that either someone hijacked an 
email address - meaning that Optimcloud is not a very *safe* company to 
do business with -&#160; or that 'Embedded Devel' at Optimcloud simply thinks 
he can get away with this - meaning that Optimcloud is not a very 
*trustworthy* company to do business with.

You have been warned.
