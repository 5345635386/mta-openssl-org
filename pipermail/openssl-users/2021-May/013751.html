<PRE>First of all, apologies to this mailing list for making you part of this.

This is the first time I hear of this. To get a few things straight (and 
I have the full email exchange at hand to back this up):
- 'embedded devel' originally asked for a developer to port old OpenSSL 
code to openssl 1.1+
- I offered to do this and ported the application to work with openssl 
1.1.1 within a few hours. 'embedded devel' agreed with me in email that 
I had achieved the original goal.
- after that, I offered to help in debugging the rest of the 
client/server application workflow, which was poorly documented but 
which had little to do with openssl specifics. I never offered or 
promised to get the entire client/server application framework working 
again.
- 'embedded devel' accepted my offer and said he had a fixed maximum 
amount that he could spend.
- I worked for the remainder of the time on analyzing and debugging the 
application workflow, even though it turned out that I was not given all 
source code. 'embedded devel' confirmed that a part was missing.
- I wrote a report with my findings and suggestions on how to proceed. 
'embedded devel' was satisfied with the report and told me he would ask 
accounting to pay me.
- after several reminders about payment he did not respond to my emails 
until I made my post yesterday, claiming for the first time that what I 
had done was not reproducible.

Reviewing this, I see no reason to change my viewpoint on the 
trustworthiness of either 'embedded devel' or the company Optimcloud.

Snipping out the rest of the mail as it is off-topic to this mailing 
list. I will reply to it privately.
