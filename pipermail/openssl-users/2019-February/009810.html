Your ticket rotation approach looks a bit fragile.

Postfix keeps two session ticket keys in memory, one that's used
to both encrypt new tickets and decrypt freshly issued tickets, and
other that's used only decrypt unexpired tickets that were isssued
just before the new key was introduced. This maintains session
ticket continuity across a single key change. The key change interval
is either equal to or is twice the maximum ticket lifetime, ensuring
that tickets are only invalidated by expiration, not key rotation.
