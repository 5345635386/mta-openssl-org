</I>I have had some fruitless discussion with the mailman authors a while
back.&#160; They seemed to insist that DMARC etc. were bad ideas and that
senders complying were broken and needed half-assed workarounds.

In my own role as postmaster, I see all these systems implementing
variations of the same concepts, that have pretty simply implications
for mailing list software:

1. The global mail system is increasingly implementing checks for
 &#160; spoofed source addresses.&#160; List gateways thus need to be
 &#160; increasingly conservative in what they send out.

2. If posts contain any kind of digital signature (PGP, S/MIME,
 &#160; DKIM etc.), the mailing list software must either preserve the
 &#160; validity by not changing anything signed or remove that signature.
 &#160;&#160; Leaving a now-invalid signature in place makes the post obviously
 &#160; bogus to anyone checking, resulting in bounces and lost mail.
 &#160;&#160; (Optionally, the list gateway may add headers describing the
 &#160; validity of those signatures before processing, perhaps even
 &#160; rejecting posts with invalid signatures to reduce spam).

3. When sending out the mails, the various from addresses must be
 &#160; appropriately authorized, either by being the list gateway itself or
 &#160; by satisfying all the known checks for any preserved addresses.

4. As mass senders of mail, mailing list gateways should themselves
 &#160; implement all the checkable features in the standards: strict SPF
 &#160; records for its own domain, DKIM signatures for any mails with
 &#160; the list gateway as source, DMARC records telling recipients to
 &#160; discard/reject messages pretending to be from the list without
 &#160; satisfying all these checks.

5. The enforcement strictness in DMARC, SPF and DKIM DNS records
 &#160; should not be taken as license to violate the requirements.&#160; For
 &#160; example an SPF rule of +all should not be treated as permission
 &#160; to use the posters domain in envelope-from.
 &#160;&#160; Frustration with spam may lead recipient systems to enforce
 &#160; more strictly than requested by the source domain.

More specific rules:

A. SPF requires the envelope-from (SMTP MAIL FROM) address to always
 &#160; be that of the list gateway, even if the posters domain has no SPF
 &#160; record.

B. A valid DKIM signature from the posters domain can allow keeping
 &#160; the poster as From: address if the DKIM signature is undamaged.

C. Some DKIM signatures allow appending a mailing list footer to the
 &#160; end of plaintext mails and adding the mailing list headers to the
 &#160; mail, others do not.&#160; In practice this is determined by
 &#160; implementation details in the posters mail server (for example,
 &#160; most versions of exim don't sign in that permissive way).
 &#160;&#160; Programmatically this can be determined by directly comparing the
 &#160; coverage indicated in the DKIM header to the intended mail
 &#160; modifications.

D. DMARC DNS records indicate if a sending domain wants to restrict
 &#160; header-From (etc.) pointing to that domain to only be used with
 &#160; at least one of DKIM and SPF passing for header-From.&#160; Rule 5
 &#160; applies, but so does rule C.


Enjoy
