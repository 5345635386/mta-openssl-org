I agree, though perhaps I should not have described what was happening
as rotation. The test that was failing with TLS1.3 was one in which
clearing the ticket keys was supposed to invalidate previously issued
keys, but it wasn't (at least, not in the same way as it did for 1.2).

&gt;<i> Postfix keeps two session ticket keys in memory, one that's used

</I>&gt;<i> other that's used only decrypt unexpired tickets that were isssued

</I>&gt;<i> ticket continuity across a single key change. The key change interval
</I>&gt;<i> is either equal to or is twice the maximum ticket lifetime, ensuring
</I>&gt;<i> that tickets are only invalidated by expiration, not key rotation.
</I>
This seems a very reasonable approach, I may propose it as the default
after we have 1.3 support, thanks.

Cheers,
Sam
