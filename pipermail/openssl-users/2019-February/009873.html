</I>Indeed it does break it (unless the signature unusually doesn't
cover the Subject).&#160;&#160; According to the RFC, a DKIM signature can
choose an almost arbitrary subset of headers to cover (including
covering the absence of a header type), plus a choice between
signing the entire body or only the first N lines (for arbitrary
N).&#160; That &quot;first N lines&quot; option is how to create a DKIM signature
that allows appending a list footer.

As for p=none, this is what my rule 5 covered, just because a DMARC
record says p=none doesn't remove the requirement for messages to
be correct, only lowers the default error handling to a warning (I
receive daily mails listing which IP addresses spoofed our domains
by sending out mails with the not doing so, as is required by the
DMARC RFC, and I did so when I had p=none).

Having a DMARC record without DKIM signatures (including DKIM
signing mails relayed with openssl.org as From: address) is either
an RFC violation or very close to one.&#160; So I would suggest setting
that up.&#160; There are probably generic plugins for Postfix already,
but check the DMARC and DKIM RFC rules for how to handle the various
special address combinations that occur in mailing list traffic
(such as having Sender and From with different domains).&#160; Because
the plugins may not have been tested for that.


Enjoy
