</I>In builds that produce shared libraries, those shared libraries
(and not a similar-but-different static library) is what needs to
be tested.

That said, it would be beneficial if the build system set the
appropriate linker flags to make the test programs (but not the
user programs such as PREFIX/bin/openssl{.exe,}) link to the
shared library in the build tree whenever the target allows
this.

Some examples:

- Windows(all versions): This is already the system default
 &#160;if the shared libraries are copied into the test program
 &#160;directory, even in Windows versions that don't search the
 &#160;current directory at invocation (which is often different
 &#160;from the program directory). However some very old Windows
 &#160;versions will only search the launch-time current dir.

- For many other targets, the -rpath option will do this
 &#160;for local runs of the tests, while for cross-compiled
 &#160;tests (for testing on hardware without local compilation),
 &#160;a more careful -rpath value is needed to reference the
 &#160;test dir on the target, not the host.

As a further improvement, where possible, the inter-library
references and the reference from the user programs compiled
from the OpenSSL source should somehow tie themselves to the
exact shared library versions used, e.g. by linking to
versioned .so file names (such as libssl.so.3.0.2), however
this does not protect recompiling and/or debugging with an
unchanged .so name.

Enjoy
