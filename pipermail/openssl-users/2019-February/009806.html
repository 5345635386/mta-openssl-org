SSL_session_reused() works in both TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 on both the client and
the server, regardless of whether the reuse comes from a traditional session or
from a ticket. If you're always getting false in TLSv1.3 then you are failing to
resume in TLSv1.3.

</I>
In TLSv1.3, by default, we issue two tickets if session reuse did not occur, and
one if reuse did occur.


&gt;<i> For both, I'm getting the session in the new session callback, and
</I>&gt;<i> then setting it with SSL_set_session(), so I'd expect resumption to

</I>
Yes - it should. It would be helpful to check whether the ticket is actually
appearing in the ClientHello or not.
