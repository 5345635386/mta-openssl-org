<PRE>These comments are on the version of the specification released on
Monday 2019-02-11 at <A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/docs/OpenSSL300Design.html">https://www.openssl.org/docs/OpenSSL300Design.html</A>

General notes on this release:

- The release was not announced on the openssl-users and
 &#160;openssl-announce mailing lists.&#160; A related blog post was
 &#160;announced two days later.

- The related strategy document is at
 &#160;<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/docs/OpenSSLStrategicArchitecture.html">https://www.openssl.org/docs/OpenSSLStrategicArchitecture.html</A>
 &#160;(This link is broken on the www.openssl.org front page).

- The draft does not link to anywhere that the public can
 &#160;inspect archived or version tracked document versions.

Non-FIPS architecture issues:

- The identifiers for predefined parameters and values (such as
 &#160;&quot;fips&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;off&quot;, &quot;aes-128-cbc&quot; should be binary values that
 &#160;cannot be easily searched in larger program files (by attackers).
 &#160; This rules out both text strings, UUID values and ASN OID values.
 &#160;Something similar to the function ids would be ideal.&#160; Note that
 &#160;to make this effective, the string names of these should not
 &#160;appear in linked binaries.
 &#160; (The context of this is linking libcrypto and/or libssl into
 &#160;closed source binary programs, since open source binaries cannot
 &#160;hide their internal structure anyway).

- It should be possible for applications to configure OpenSSL to
 &#160;load provider DLLs and config files from their own directories
 &#160;rather than the global well-known directory (isolation from
 &#160;system wide changes).

- It should be possible for providers (possibly not the FIPS
 &#160;provider) to be linked directly into programs that link
 &#160;statically to libcrypto.&#160; This implies the absence of
 &#160;conflicting identifiers, a public API to pass the address of
 &#160;a |OSSL_provider_init|function, all bundled providers provided
 &#160;as static libraries in static library builds, and a higher
 &#160;level init function that initializes both libcrypto and the
 &#160;default provider.

- Static library forms of the default provider should not
 &#160;force callers to include every algorithm just because they
 &#160;are referenced from the default dispatch tables.&#160; For example,
 &#160;it should be easy to link a static application that uses only
 &#160;AES-256-CBC and SHA-256, and contains little else.&#160; Such limited
 &#160;feature applications would obviously have to forego using the
 &#160;all-inclusive high level init function.

- For use with engine-like providers (such as hardware providers
 &#160;and the PKCS#11 provider), it should be possible for a provider
 &#160;to provide algorithms like RSA at multiple abstraction levels.
 &#160; For example, some PKCS#11 hardware provides the raw RSA
 &#160;algorithm (bignum in, bignum out) while others provide specific
 &#160;forms such as PKCS#1.5 signature.&#160; There are even some that
 &#160;provide the PKCS#1.5 form with some hashes and the RSA form
 &#160;as a general fallback.

- Similarly, some providers will provide both ends of an
 &#160;asymmetric algorithm, while others only provide the private
 &#160;key operation, leaving the public key operation to other
 &#160;providers (selected by core in the general way).

- The general bignum library should be exposed via an API, either
 &#160;the legacy OpenSSL bignum API or a replacement API with an overlap
 &#160;of at least one major version with both APIs available.

- Provider algorithm implementations should carry
 &#160;description/selection parameters indicating limits to access:
 &#160;&quot;key-readable=yes/no&quot;, &quot;key-writable=yes/no&quot;, &quot;data-internal=yes/no&quot;,
 &#160;&quot;data-external=yes/no&quot; and &quot;iv-internal=yes/no&quot;.&#160; For example,
 &#160;a smartcard-like provider may have &quot;key-readable=no&quot; and
 &#160;&quot;key-writable=yes&quot; for RSA keys, while another card may have
 &#160;&quot;key-writable=no&quot; (meaning that externally generated keys cannot
 &#160;be imported to the card.&#160; &quot;data-internal&quot; refers to the
 &#160;ability to process (encrypt, hash etc.) data internal to the
 &#160;provider, such as other keys, while &quot;data-external&quot; refers to
 &#160;the ability to process arbitrary application data.

- Variable key length algorithm implementations should carry
 &#160;description/selection parameters indicating maximum and minimum
 &#160;key lengths (Some will refuse to process short keys, others will
 &#160;refuse long keys, some will require the key length to be a
 &#160;multiple of some number).

- The current EVP interface abuses the general (re)init operations
 &#160;with omitted arguments as the main interface to update rapidly
 &#160;changing algorithm parameters such as IVs and/or keys.&#160; With the
 &#160;removal of legacy APIs, the need to provide parameter changing
 &#160;as explicit calls in the EVP API and provider has become more
 &#160;obvious.

- A provider property valuable to some callers (and already a known
 &#160;property of some legacy APIs) is to declare that certain simple
 &#160;operations will always succeed, such as passing additional data
 &#160;bytes to a hash/mac (the rare cases of hardware disconnect and/or
 &#160;exceeding the algorithm maximums can be deferred to &quot;finish&quot;
 &#160;operations).&#160; A name for this property of an algorithm
 &#160;implementation could be &quot;nofail=yes&quot;, and the list of non-failing
 &#160;operations defined for each type of algorithm should be publicly
 &#160;specified (a nofail hash would have a different list than a
 &#160;no-fail symmetric encryption).

- Providers that are really bridges to another multi-provider API
 &#160;(ENGINE, PKCS#11, MS CAPI 1, MS CNG) should be explicitly allowed
 &#160;to load/init separately for each underlying provider.&#160; For example,
 &#160;it would be bad for an application talking to one PKCS#11 module to
 &#160;run, load or block all other PKCS#11 modules on the system.

- Under normal file system layout conventions, /usr/share/ (and
 &#160;below) is for architecture-independent files such as man pages,
 &#160;trusted root certificates and platform-independent include files.
 &#160; Architecture specific files such as &quot;openssl/providers/foo.so&quot;
 &#160;and opensslconf.h belong in /usr/ or /usr/local/ .


FIPS-specific issues:

- The checksum of the FIPS DLL should be compiled into the FIPS-
 &#160;capable OpenSSL library, since a checksum stored in its own file
 &#160;on the end user system is too easily replaced by attackers.&#160; This
 &#160;also implies that each FIPS DLL version will need its own file name
 &#160;in case different applications are linked to different libcrypto
 &#160;versions (because they were started before an upgrade of the shared
 &#160;libcrypto or because they use their own copy of libcrypto).

- If possible, the core or a libcrypto-provided FIPS-wrapper should
 &#160;check the hash of the opensslfips-3.x.x.so DLL before running any
 &#160;of its code (including on-load stubs), secondly, the DLL can
 &#160;recheck itself using its internal implementation of the chosen MAC
 &#160;algorithm, if this is required by the CMVP.&#160; This is to protect the
 &#160;application if a totally unrelated malicious file is dropped in
 &#160;place of the DLL.

- The document seems to consistently only mentions the
 &#160;shortest/weakest key lengths, such as AES-128.&#160; Hopefully the
 &#160;actual release will have no such limitation.

- The well-known slowness of FIPS validations will in practice
 &#160;require the FIPS module compiled from a source change to be
 &#160;released (much) later than the same change in the default
 &#160;provider.&#160; The draft method of submitting FIPS validation
 &#160;updates just before any FIPS-affecting OpenSSL release seems
 &#160;overly optimistic.

- Similarly, due to the slowness of FIPS validation updates,
 &#160;it may often be prudent to provide a root-cause fix in the
 &#160;default provider and a less-effective change in the FIPS
 &#160;provider, possibly involving FIPS-frozen workaround code in
 &#160;libcrypto, either in core or in a separate FIPS-wrapper
 &#160;component.

- The mechanisms for dealing with cannot-export-the-private-key
 &#160;hardware providers could also be used to let the FIPS provider
 &#160;offer algorithm variants where the crypto officer (application
 &#160;writer/installer) specify that some keys remain inside the
 &#160;FIPS blob, inaccessible to the user role (application code).
 &#160; For example, TLS PFS (EC)DHE keys and CMS per message keys
 &#160;could by default remain inside the provider.&#160; Extending this
 &#160;to TLS session keys and server private key would be a future
 &#160;option.

- In future versions, it should be possible to combine the
 &#160;bundled FIPS provider with providers for FIPS-validated hardware,
 &#160;such as FIPS validated PIV smart cards for TLS client
 &#160;certificates.

- Support for generating and validating (EC)DH and (EC)DSA
 &#160;group parameters using the FIPS-specified algorithms should
 &#160;be available in addition to the fixed sets of well-known
 &#160;group parameters.&#160; In FIPS 800-56A rev 3, these are the
 &#160;DH primes specified using a SEED value.&#160; Other versions of
 &#160;SP 800-56A, and/or supplemental NIST documents may allow
 &#160;other such group parameters.

- If permitted by the CMVP rules, allow an option for
 &#160;application provided (additional) entropy input to the RNG
 &#160;from outside the module boundary.

Enjoy
