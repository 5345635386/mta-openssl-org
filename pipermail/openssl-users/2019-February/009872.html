In TLSv1.2 New session tickets are written as part of the handshake. In TLSv1.3
session tickets are sent after the handshake has completed. It sounds to me like
the info callback is doing the right thing.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Oh - right. I missed this detail. Calling SSL_shutdown() from inside a callback

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The info callback, or ANY callbacks? What about the new ticket
</I>&gt;<i> callback, for example? Is it expected that no SSL_ calls are made in
</I>&gt;<i> ANY callbacks?
</I>
I wouldn't go that far. Callbacks occur during the processing of an IO
operation. Callbacks are generally expected to be small and quick. I wouldn't
call anything that might invoke a new IO operation from within a callback, so
SSL_read, SSL_write, SSL_do_handshake, SSL_shutdown etc.
