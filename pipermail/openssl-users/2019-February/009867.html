Yes you may.  Quite frankly, I'm frustrated with the situation, and
it...  well, kinda exploded today (getting a huge bunch of messages
from mailman tell us that it had disabled this and that user, it
turned out to be quite a lot of them...).  Either way, I'll take any
help I can get to get some clarity and a path forward.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seem like DMARC, SPF, DKIM, or *something* is tripping us up quite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a bit.  Earlier this afternoon (that's what it is in Sweden at least),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; us postmasters got a deluge of bounce reports from mailman, basically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; telling us that it got something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">user at example.com</A>&gt;: host aspmx.l.google.com[74.125.140.26] said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      550-5.7.1 This message does not have authentication information or fails to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      pass 550-5.7.1 authentication checks. To best protect our users from spam,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      the 550-5.7.1 message has been blocked. Please visit 550-5.7.1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      <A HREF="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126#authentication">https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126#authentication</A> for more 550
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      5.7.1 information. f1si3266960wro.105 - gsmtp (in reply to end of DATA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      command)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's very little fact of what actually triggered these bounces, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they always come from Google, so we're guessing that they're becoming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; increasingly aggressive in their checks of DKIM, SPF, ARC, who knows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (they don't seem to check DMARC, 'cause we do have one with p=none and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an address to sent DMARC reports to, and I'm hearing absolutely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nothing from Google, but I do hear from others)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The onus for getting the attention of the mail admins at Google needs
</I>&gt;<i> to be on those who use their services for mail, and not on a third
</I>&gt;<i> party. If this were a non-technical list (the high school soccer team
</I>&gt;<i> schedule), I might not expect all of the list members to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> discuss in technical terms with the Google mail admins what the
</I>&gt;<i> problems may be, but people on this list should be able to get the
</I>&gt;<i> relevant points across, citing RFC numbers and so forth.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I often find myself assisting other admins (aren't we all on
</I>&gt;<i> alternating sides of that coin?) when we have delivery problems. The
</I>&gt;<i> biggest hurdle is getting to the right admin on the &quot;problem&quot; side,
</I>&gt;<i> which is why the initial contact needs to come from one of their
</I>&gt;<i> customers who has been affected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, to mitigate the problem, we've removed all extra decoration of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; messages, i.e. the list footer that's usually added and the subject
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tag that indicates what list this is (I added the &quot;openssl-users:&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that you see manually).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I strongly encourage you to re-think this. Everyone else on this list
</I>&gt;<i> whose server has been properly configured to not trash legitimate
</I>&gt;<i> messages must now be inconvenienced by the needs of a seemingly
</I>&gt;<i> tone-deaf provider. (FWIW, I go through this with yahoo.com addresses
</I>&gt;<i> all the time; the fault lies there, not in the list configuration - so
</I>&gt;<i> long as the list configuration follows the applicable RFC guidelines.)
</I>
Well, if we change the subject of a DKIM signed message, don't we
break it?  (I'm not sure how applicable that's with Google, as we
received the same kind of bounce for message originating at
openssl.org (there is a DMARC record with p=none, so shouldn't affect
anything as far as I understand) and no DKIM signature...  but still,
when there is one...

&gt;<i> &gt; So IF you're filtering the messages to get list messages in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different folder, based on the subject line, you will unfortunately
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to change it.  If I may suggest something, it's to look at this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      List-Id: &lt;openssl-users.openssl.org&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this can be done, but without the list ID in square brackets in
</I>&gt;<i> the subject, what is liable to happen is that the entire string will
</I>&gt;<i> be replaced along the line when thread subjects change (e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;blah-blah (was: blah)&quot;) and we would all have to remember to type
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;openssl-users:&quot; in order to get &quot;organized&quot; subjects (yes, I know;
</I>&gt;<i> filtering to a particular folder on the List-Id header should
</I>&gt;<i> effectively &quot;organize&quot; list messages by corralling them, but that's
</I>&gt;<i> not my point). Threading is liable to go at least slightly off the
</I>&gt;<i> rails for some of us (depending upon mail client), and there are a
</I>&gt;<i> host of potential side effects, all for what? The next time Google
</I>&gt;<i> decides to change their filters, should list managers hop-to and make
</I>&gt;<i> further changes?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My own thinking is that if list messages cannot proliferate across
</I>&gt;<i> Google's infrastructure, then those list members should find
</I>&gt;<i> alternative means of subscribing. Undoubtedly, this is not the only
</I>&gt;<i> list which would be so affected for them.
</I>
Well, Google users is a *large* part of our subscribers, and some of
them are Google Apps users, possibly not of their own choice.  I
believe that Google users aren't quite as easy to dismiss as, say,
hotmail back when that provider tumbled down the reputation shute.

Cheers,
Richard
