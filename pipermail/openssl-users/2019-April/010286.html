<PRE>&gt;<i> there is no &quot;min&quot; version in Client Hello, the version in record layer is irrelevant and used only for backwards compatibility *NOT* for negotiation
</I>Thank you for the information. But have a doubt, then what is the importance of SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version() and SSL_CTX_set_max_proto_version() introduced in 1.1.X along with SSL_CTX_set_options().

I would like to know how to disable TLSv1.0 and 1.1 using configure option[CONFOPTS] in Makefile.

Thanks in advance,
Chethan Kumar

compile an openssl server with TLS 1.1 enabled, run openssl s_server -tls1_1 to enable just TLS 1.1 and see if your production compile can connect
