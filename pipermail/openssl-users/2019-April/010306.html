&gt;<i> Hi Matt,

</I>&gt;<i> Many thanks for your informative reply.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So it seems the best approach is to  upgrade to a version of OpenSSL  supporting the SSL_OP_NO_RENGOTIATION option.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this option is enabled will it  still allow server-initiated secure  renegotiations if TLS 1.3 is being used?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The docs suggests that only  client side renegotiation requests are disabled in TLS 1.3.
</I>
Renegotiation does not exist as a concept in TLSv1.3 so this option has no
impact in TLSv1.3.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The legacy_renegotiation option does something different to what you think it does. This option allows &quot;insecure&quot; renegotiation as opposed to the later (and
</I>&gt;<i> default) &quot;secure&quot; renegotiation. This dates back to 2009 when a flaw in the TLS protocol for renegotiation was discovered.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, I suppose I firstly need to know if the results from testssl.sh 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and from my own investigations point to a potential security risk by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way of a DoS attack?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Over the years there have been many attacks against renegotiation. They've all been fixed, however since this is a common attack vector and many applications don't need this feature it is often recommended that it is disabled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If so, what is the best way to prevent this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The best way is to upgrade to a recent version of OpenSSL and use the SSL_OP_NO_RENGOTIATION option for this purpose (available from 1.1.0h and above).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you *must* use OpenSSL 1.0.2 then there is a way to do it but it is undocumented and unfortunately this method is no longer possible in OpenSSL 1.1.0+ due to the opacity changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can mark a particular SSL object (call it &quot;s&quot;) so that it should not do renegotiation like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> s-&gt;s3-&gt;flags |= SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From what I've read online it isn't possible to disable 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client-initiated secure renegotiation in openssl.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Indeed, it could be argued that there are circumstances when it is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perfectly valid for a client to renegotiate a connection  especially 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if it is a long-running connection.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The only  way I could find of limiting such an attack was to track the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number of renegotiation requests over a time and if we get a high 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number  in a short period  then close the connection.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I believe this can be done  in a callback function  set up via a call to:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SSL_CTX_set_info_callback
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd recommend against this approach. A number of applications took this route due to a lack of a good alternative. However it can have unexpected consequences if you later upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1 and start using TLSv1.3 (where a number of legitimate interactions happen post-handshake that can be mistaken for renegotiations).
