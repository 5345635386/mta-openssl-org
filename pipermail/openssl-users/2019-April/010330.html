<PRE>Dear all,

Can someone please explain the need for different files like s2_srvr.c, s3_srvr.c and s23_srvr.c in ssl folder.
I need to know the difference because ssl23_client_hello() is getting called for all communication happening using sslv3, tls1.0/1.1/1.2
Then what is the use of ssl3_client_hello() in s3_srvr.c and client_hello() in s2_srvr.c
Does ssl23_client_hello() is getting called internally for all versions?
If so, can some please point where does this internal call happens.

Thanks in advance,
Chethan Kumar
