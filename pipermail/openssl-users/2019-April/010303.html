No - renegotiation was successful.

</I>
The legacy_renegotiation option does something different to what you think it
does. This option allows &quot;insecure&quot; renegotiation as opposed to the later (and
default) &quot;secure&quot; renegotiation. This dates back to 2009 when a flaw in the TLS
protocol for renegotiation was discovered.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I suppose I firstly need to know if the results from testssl.sh and from
</I>&gt;<i> my own investigations point to a potential security risk by way of a DoS
</I>&gt;<i> attack?
</I>
Over the years there have been many attacks against renegotiation. They've all
been fixed, however since this is a common attack vector and many applications
don't need this feature it is often recommended that it is disabled.


&gt;<i> If so, what is the best way to prevent this.
</I>
The best way is to upgrade to a recent version of OpenSSL and use the
SSL_OP_NO_RENGOTIATION option for this purpose (available from 1.1.0h and above).

If you *must* use OpenSSL 1.0.2 then there is a way to do it but it is
undocumented and unfortunately this method is no longer possible in OpenSSL
1.1.0+ due to the opacity changes.

You can mark a particular SSL object (call it &quot;s&quot;) so that it should not do
renegotiation like this:

s-&gt;s3-&gt;flags |= SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS;


&gt;<i> From what I've read online it isn't possible to disable client-initiated
</I>&gt;<i> secure renegotiation in openssl.
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, it could be argued that there are circumstances when it is perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> valid for a client to renegotiate a connection  especially if it is a
</I>&gt;<i> long-running connection.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only  way I could find of limiting such an attack was to track the
</I>&gt;<i> number of renegotiation requests over a time and if we get a high number  in
</I>&gt;<i> a short period  then close the connection.
</I>&gt;<i> I believe this can be done  in a callback function  set up via a call to:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> SSL_CTX_set_info_callback
</I>
I'd recommend against this approach. A number of applications took this route
due to a lack of a good alternative. However it can have unexpected consequences
if you later upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1 and start using TLSv1.3 (where a number of
legitimate interactions happen post-handshake that can be mistaken for
renegotiations).
