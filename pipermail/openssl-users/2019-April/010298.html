</I>Since we have many applications using openssl services, it is difficult to implement this in all applications.

I need to find a single point in openssl source code[If not in Makefile] to disable TLSv1.0 and TLS1.1 for both server and client communications.

Thanks in advance,
Chethan

Ah! My apologies - I've just now realised that you are using OpenSSL 1.0.2 (and going back to your original post I see that you did actually say that). Sorry for misleading you.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 works differently to later versions in this regards and quite inconsistently. You can disable SSLv2 and SSLv3 at compile time (SSLv2 is disabled by default) using the no-ssl2 and no-ssl3 options.

If you want to disable TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 then you should do so at run time.
Use the SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1 and SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1 options to the
SSL_CTX_set_options() or SSL_set_options() functions.
