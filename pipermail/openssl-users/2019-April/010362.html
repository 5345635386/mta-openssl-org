&gt;<i> We are using OpenSSL 1.1.0h on Linux to send operations to LDAP servers. We use SSL_read()
</I>&gt;<i> to receive the replies on a non-blocking socket. The vast majority of times SSL_read()  returns &gt;0,
</I>&gt;<i> SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE as per the spec. However we are very
</I>&gt;<i> occasionally seeing SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL with errno 11 (EAGAIN) which would seem to be the
</I>&gt;<i> result of a platform socket read(() or write() when blocking would occur. Is this expected
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour? We have changed our code to treat this as SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or
</I>&gt;<i> SSL_WANT_WRITE depending on the result of SSL_want_write(). Are we correct?
</I>&#160;
I haven't seen a reply to this, so I'll take a stab...

I haven't looked at the code, but my impression is that WANT_READ and WANT_WRITE are returned in two cases: when OpenSSL has received or sent a partial record and needs to complete it; or when the TLS state is such that OpenSSL needs to perform the associated operation and it hasn't been requested by the application - for example, if the application is trying to receive data but OpenSSL needs to send renegotiation information.

If you do a non-blocking receive at a record boundary (so you don't have an incomplete record) and OpenSSL doesn't currently need to send for TLS reasons, OpenSSL will see the EAGAIN (or EWOULDBLOCK, depending on platform). I think in this case it does just return SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL, because OpenSSL itself doesn't &quot;want&quot; to receive. If OpenSSL had already received a partial record, then you'd get WANT_READ.

I suspect you could always treat this as WANT_READ, which typically means using a mechanism such as select or poll to determine when the socket is readable, then trying the OpenSSL receive again. But looking at the return value of SSL_want_write() seems safe enough.

That's my understanding. Someone else may know better.
