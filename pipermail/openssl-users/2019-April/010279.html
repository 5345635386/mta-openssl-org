<PRE>Adding to previous mail,
We tried -DSSL_OP_NO_TLSv1   -DSSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1  along with disabling SSLv2 and v1 but still client hello is sent using min and max as TLS1.0 and TLS1.2.

Any idea what is wrong in our options and what should be used instead.?

Thanks in advance,
Chethan Kumar

Subject: How to disable tls 1.0 and tls 1.1

Dear all,

Kindly help me out in knowing how to disable TLS1.0 and TLS1.1 while compiling openssl package.
I am using 1.0.2n openssl version and disabled SSLv1 and v2 using -DSSL_OP_NO_SSLv2, -DOPENSSL_NO_SSL3 and -DOPENSSL_NO_SSL2.

I also have a doubt on difference between -DSSL_OP_NO_SSLv2, -DOPENSSL_NO_SSL3 and -DOPENSSL_NO_SSL2.
Can someone please explain the difference.

Thanks in advance,
Chethan Kumar
