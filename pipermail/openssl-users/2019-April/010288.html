<PRE>&gt;<i>what evidence you have that what you do is ineffective?
</I>I tried connecting to some host by executing curl command with --tlsv1.1 and --tlsv1.0 options and am able to connect successfully.

&gt;<i>why you're not using?
</I>&gt;<i>./config no-tls1 no-tls1_1
</I>I have used these options in Makefile but still communication with TLS1.0 and TLS1.1 is working.
Confirmed by checking openssl/opensslconf.h file for OPENSSL_NO_TLS1 and OPENSSL_NO_TLS1_1 macros and macros are generated.

Kindly let me know what could be changed to disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1 at least by changing code in openssl.

when the minimum set is higher than what the server answers with, the *client* will reject the connection after receiving ServerHello

that is:
when SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version is set to tls 1.2, SSL_CTX_set_max_proto_version si set to tls 1.3 and the server replies with ServerHello.version of (3, 2) i.e. TLS 1.1 the client will abort the connection
