<PRE>Hi all,

A customer of ours was recently running security checks against our mail
server.  To do this they were running the testssl.sh script available at:

<A HREF="https://testssl.sh/">https://testssl.sh/</A>

The test tool reports a potential DoS thread as a result of client-initiated
secure renegotiation as shown from the following line from the test tool's
output:


[1m Secure Client-Initiated Renegotiation     [m[0;33mVULNERABLE (NOT
ok)[m, potential DoS threat

I have also reproduced  their findings in-house.

Our mail server is using version 1.0.2g of openssl  and  the client openssl
version was 1.0.2j.

In the testssl.sh script  it connects to the ssl port using TLS1.2  and the
legacy_renegotiation option.

When I do a similar  test in my test environment  I  get results like the
below:

 Issue  a connect request, pause for 1 second and then Send 'R'  to start a
renegotiation:

(echo -n; sleep 1; echo R) | openssl s_client -CAfile NightlyBuild-CA.cert
-crlf -tls1_2 -legacy_renegotiation -connect &lt;hostname&gt;:465

Output is as follows:

verify return:1
depth=0 C = ie, CN = something, CN = devimpala13.es.cpth.ie
verify return:1
DONE

So, as you can see the  initial connection is successful.   The
renegotiation  begins and  it returns:

verify return:1

I'm not sure if this means  renegotiation has failed?  Either way the
connection remains open.  Presumably if a client issued a large number of
renegotiations like this the server could become overwhelmed.

Note that I got the same results if I remove the -legacy_renegotiation
option, so I don't think  this has any impact?

So, I suppose I firstly need to know if the results from testssl.sh and from
my own investigations point to a potential security risk by way of a DoS
attack?

If so, what is the best way to prevent this.
&gt;<i>From what I've read online it isn't possible to disable client-initiated
</I>secure renegotiation in openssl.
Indeed, it could be argued that there are circumstances when it is perfectly
valid for a client to renegotiate a connection  especially if it is a
long-running connection.

The only  way I could find of limiting such an attack was to track the
number of renegotiation requests over a time and if we get a high number  in
a short period  then close the connection.
I believe this can be done  in a callback function  set up via a call to:

SSL_CTX_set_info_callback


So, is the above information correct or is there a better way of preventing
this sort of attack.  Do we really need to allow a limited form of
client-based secure renegotiation?

If preventing an attack by way of monitoring the number of renegotiations
over time is the only good approach, do you have any code examples in C as
to how to implement this?

Many thanks,

Tim
