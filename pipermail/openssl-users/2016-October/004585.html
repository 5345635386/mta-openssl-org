and the non-US developers, never actually touching the code.

</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL and SSLeay has always had US contributions, it's just that we were done indirectly.  For example, &quot;git show eb64730&quot; which was early 2000.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This fact was *not* published widely enough to be seen by
everyone concerned.  It was certainly not published as widely
as the fact that SSLeay was created and maintained entirely
outside the US, and that this was one of its major attractions.

Basically that internal checkin (which I have no idea what is,
since I only see the released tarballs) or any earlier US code
changes would have been a watershed change.

Enjoy
