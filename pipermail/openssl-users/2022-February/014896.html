Well, now that we're past the XY problem, there's good news and bad
news.

Good news:

    * If you control the server, the server's private key is typically
      stored in the server's private key file (possible same as its
      certificate file).  If the server is OpenSSL rather than Java
      based, it would typically already be in PEM format, ...

Bad news:

    * Even with the server's private key, you generally can't decrypt TLS
      traffic, when, as is typical and best-practice, the negotiated
      cipher has forward-secrecy (uses DH or ECDH key exchange).

To actually decode the traffic, you'd need to configure the server or
client to record the session &quot;master secret&quot;.  A client-side example
is discussed in:

    <A HREF="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/decrypting-ssl-tls-traffic-with-wireshark/">https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/decrypting-ssl-tls-traffic-with-wireshark/</A>

Alternatively, In the blog post at:

    <A HREF="https://blog.didierstevens.com/2020/12/14/decrypting-tls-streams-with-wireshark-part-1/">https://blog.didierstevens.com/2020/12/14/decrypting-tls-streams-with-wireshark-part-1/</A>

there's an example which downgrades the client TLS parameters to use at
most TLS 1.2 and RSA key transport (instead of DH), which then makes it
it possible to use the server's private key to decrypt the traffic.
