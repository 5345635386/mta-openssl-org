<PRE>I want to have debug and optimized DLLs/LIBs for use by developers who need them to link their or open source code.
I can manually rename the LIBs, but I can't rename the DLLs since the LIBs provide the original name of the DLLs.

Any suggestions?  I know that the DCMTK team built their own DLLs and LIBS for OpenSSL 1.1.1w and they were able to do it.
I'm not sure what they did.  I've looked in the doc, but haven't noticed anything.

Thanks.
