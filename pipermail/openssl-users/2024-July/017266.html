<PRE>Hi All,

I had to change the names of the .lib files to:
       &quot;dcmtkcrypto_d.lib&quot; - debug version
       &quot;dcmtkcrypto_o.lib&quot; - release version (optimized)
       &quot;dcmtkssl_d.lib&quot;    - debug version
       &quot;dcmtkssl_o.lib&quot;    - release version (optimized)
This was required by the DCMTK team's CMake configuration steps.
Without doing this the configuration failed to find the correct parts of OpenSSL.
See: <A HREF="https://github.com/DCMTK/dcmtk/blob/59f75a8b50e50ae1bb1ff12098040c6327500740/INSTALL#L634">https://github.com/DCMTK/dcmtk/blob/59f75a8b50e50ae1bb1ff12098040c6327500740/INSTALL#L634</A>

I noticed that their OpenSSL 1.1.1w zip file has DLLs with different names, too.
They are named:
dcmtkcrypto-1_1-x64.dll
dcmtkcrypto_d-1_1-x64.dll
dcmtkssl-1_1-x64.dll
dcmtkssl_d-1_1-x64.dll

Is there a option when building my own OpenSSL 3.0.8 libraries that will name the libraries and DLLs like this?

Is renaming them manually going to be OK?  Will the DLL be found when the application that requires it attempts to load it?
I'm just getting back into Windows development after many years.

Thanks
