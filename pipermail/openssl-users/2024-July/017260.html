<PRE>Hi,
I was wondering if the build scripts could handling providing -debug and -release for a build.
Would this create release and debug libraries in a single build?
Thanks.

P.S.  I know I could try it, but I thought others might want to know later too.  Perhaps an update in the INSTALL.md file.
