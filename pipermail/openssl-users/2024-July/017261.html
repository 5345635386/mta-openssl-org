<PRE>Thanks Neil.
I just want to end up having a debug and release version of each library.
I need to rename them for use with DCMTK to the following.
     openssl:
       &quot;dcmtkcrypto_d.lib&quot; - debug version
       &quot;dcmtkcrypto_o.lib&quot; - release version (optimized)
       &quot;dcmtkssl_d.lib&quot;    - debug version
       &quot;dcmtkssl_o.lib&quot;    - release version (optimized)

It seems they expect those file names and use them when generating a build system with CMake.

you can supply both, but they don't create separate libraries. The --debug and --release just set different optimization flags on the compiler (-g -O0 vs -O3) If you want to be able to provide an optimized production build, and supply a

If you want to be able to provide an optimized production build, and supply a level of debugability (though not as good as building with -O0), you're best bet, is to build with -g and -O3, then use objcopy to separate the debug sections into their own file, then strip the debug info from the initial dso.  This is how most distributions create their debuginfo packages

Hi,
I was wondering if the build scripts could handling providing &#8211;debug and &#8211;release for a build.
Would this create release and debug libraries in a single build?
Thanks.

P.S.  I know I could try it, but I thought others might want to know later too.  Perhaps an update in the INSTALL.md file.
