Sorry, I should have been clearer.

I didn't mean the HTTP requests etc. I agree that that should not be
done by libcrypto.

I was more talking about the parsing. Currently I have 40 LOC [1] to
find the OCSP URL from a certificate; it seems to me that that's a lot
of stuff that I shouldn't have to be doing, and that asking OpenSSL to
parse out that URL (or really, any other X.509v3 extension's data)
should not be too complicated.

Perhaps I missed the call that I should have been using, though ;-)

&gt;<i> &#10146;     - Currently I don't fall back to CRLs when the OCSP server is

</I>&gt;<i>     should be doing, rather than manually parsing the CRL?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> X509_CRL_verify.  And yes, looking through to find the serial# is what you have to do.
</I>
That's 1.1-specific, correct?
