 |&gt; I do not know why lighttpd ends up on /dev/random for you, but in
 |&gt; my opinion the Linux random stuff is both sophisticated and sucks.

P.S.: i have now looked at the OpenSSL code and understand what
you have said.  It indeed selects on /dev/random.

 |&gt; The latter because (it seems that many) people end up using
 |&gt; haveged or similar to pimp up their entropy artificially, whereas
 |&gt; on the other side the initial OS seeding is no longer truly
 |&gt; supported.  Writing some seed to /dev/urandom does not bring any
 |&gt; entropy to the &quot;real&quot; pool.

Oh, still, for example AlpineLinux did (and still does i think,
using a script originating from Gentoo aka OpenRC) save a kilobyte
of /dev/urandom storage, to restore it upon next boot.  But it
does not feed the pool which feds /dev/random, it does not count
against /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail.

Even that i can understand a little bit (physical access would
reveal data stored in the entropy file), even though the entropy
is not used but passed through state machines, which could be
furtherly randomized when fed back in, like also dependent on the
host hardware environment interrupts which happen and depend on
actual devices i'd say, and while doing so.

But you loose all the entropy that the machine collected during
its last uptime, so you solely depend on some CPU features and the
noise that system startup produces to create a startup entropy.
After running in the problem and looking around i realized that
many people seem to run the haveged daemon (there is also a kernel
module which does something like this, but using it did not help
me out), which applies some maths, and it is mystic as it can
produce thousands of random bits in less than a second!

Even on my brand new laptop, which (stepped a decade of hardware
development for me and) has a 8th generation i5, i see hangs of
several seconds (iirc) without the little helper i attached in the
last message.  With it i have a (SysV init/BSD rc script aka
CRUX-Linux) boot time of two seconds, which is so horny i have to
write it down.

 |This makes me very surprised that they removed such a widely used

 |kernel?

Hm, ok, what they have actually removed was the RNDGETPOOL
ioctl(2) (according to random(4)).  Then my claim regarding
deprecation was misleaded and wrong.

Nonetheless it has to be said that today an administrator does not
have, that is, i have no idea whether systemd provides something
to overcome this, the possibility to simply feed in good entropy
via a shell script, unless i am mistaken.
