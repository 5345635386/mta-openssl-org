<PRE>Hi Matt,

Neither tree is &quot;clean&quot; at this point.  That is the very reason for my problem.  My set of patches leaves out some changes because they can be generated by &quot;make update&quot;.  This works fine on Unix but not on Windows.

Starting with a clean version of 1.1.1a I have to apply up to a dozen patch files to get our bespoke version.  These include a specific version of cmpossl, which is where cmp and crmf come from (currently being integrated into master but not available in any release yet), plus some of our own patches on top of that which add yet more functions and error codes.  Hence the err files and libcrypto.num will differ depending on which of these patches are applied for a particular build.

Running &quot;make update&quot; includes &quot;make errors&quot; which does create any missing err.h and _err.c files.  (Obviously the new libnames have to be patched into openssl.ec.)

In hindsight maybe the cumulative changes to those err files and libcrypto.num should have been part of the individual patches.  At the time it seemed cleaner to simply use &quot;make update&quot; and have them generated cleanly for whatever subset of patches has been applied.

Regards,
Andrew.

</I>
Are you sure the Linux tree you are using is a clean version of 1.1.1? Similarly with your original Windows tree? The 1.1.1 distribution does not have any files names cmperr.h or crmferr.h, and neither are there cmp or crmf subdirectories in the crypto dir. &quot;make update&quot; certainly should not be creating those files.
These things *do* exist in master, but not in 1.1.1.

I suggest starting from scratch with clean trees.

But with our patches applied the build fails once it gets to crypto/cmp because the include files cmperr.h and crmferr.h do not exist.  On Linux these are created by make update.  The Windows Makefile does not have a target &quot;update&quot; (or &quot;errors&quot; for that matter).
