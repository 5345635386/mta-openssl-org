Perhaps it would have been more acceptable to use a binary base,
instead of a decimal percentage, as there is nothing inherently
decimal about this value.

Good options inspired by other cryptographic libraries include:

- Number of bits of entropy passed in call (For example, a
 &#160;perfectly balanced coin flipper could provide the 4 byte
 &#160;values &quot;head&quot; or &quot;tail&quot; with an entropy of 1 bit).

- 256th of bits ditto (for example a coin flipper with a known
 &#160;slight imbalance could report 252/256th of a bit for each flip
 &#160;included in the buffer).

- 32th of bits ditto (makes the &quot;100%&quot; case equal to
 &#160;(bytecount &lt;&lt; 8)).

In each of those 3 cases, the internal measure of &quot;entropy
left&quot; would be in that same unit, and a compatibility mapping
for the old API would do the conversion of the double as a
pure inline macro that doesn't trigger &quot;float used&quot; compiler
magics in programs that don't use it.

Clarifying notes:

- The current limit of considering only 32 bytes of entropy
 &#160;is an artifact of the current set of RNG algorithms, and
 &#160;should not be exposed in the API design.&#160; For example
 &#160;future addition of post-quantum algorithms may necessitate
 &#160;having an RNG with an internal state entropy larger than
 &#160;256 bits.

- Future RNG implementations may include logic to safely
 &#160;accumulate obtained entropy into &quot;batches&quot; before updating
 &#160;the RNG state, as this may have cryptographic benefits.

- The use of a dummy double to force the alignment of
 &#160;structures and unions to the &quot;highest known&quot; value can
 &#160;be trivially replaced by another type where it is not
 &#160;already treated as &quot;not actually floating point
 &#160;operations&quot; by the compiler.&#160; For example by passing
 &#160;&quot;-Ddouble=long long&quot; as a compiler option.

- The use of floating point registers in CPU-specific
 &#160;vector unit optimizations can be readily avoided by
 &#160;a no-asm compile.

- Floating point calculations in test programs such as
 &#160;&quot;openssl speed&quot; is not relevant to actual library use.

- On Linux x86, test programs that avoid all floating
 &#160;point can be checked via the PF_USED_MATH flag or its
 &#160;upcoming Linux 5.x replacement.&#160; This may be useful
 &#160;in the test suite.


Enjoy
