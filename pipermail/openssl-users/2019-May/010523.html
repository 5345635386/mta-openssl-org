<PRE>Thanks for the input.

&gt;&gt;<i> If applications set this using SSL_set_tlsext_host_name(), is it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correct to print hostname/IP in  tlsext_hostname.
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;correct&quot; in what sense? &quot;print&quot; where?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe. You haven't explained what you're trying to do.
</I>What we are trying to achieve is, if there is failure in connection between host and destination, then at the host side, log messages saying to which destination it got failed.
That's why, need to know the hostname/IP address of the destination.
Since many applications use openssl, we want to log messages from openssl side.
Is it ok if application set IP/hostname using SSL_set_tlsext_host_name() and at openssl side, we refer tlsext_hostname to log the message.?

Thanks in advance,
Chethan Kumar

That's the SNI hostname, which is set by the client to the hostname (or possibly some other string identifier, such as the text representation of an IP address) that it thinks it wants to connect to. It's used by the server to determine what certificate to send to the client. It's not a reliable indicator of the server's hostname, and has nothing to do with the client's hostname.

</I>
&quot;correct&quot; in what sense? &quot;print&quot; where?

Forget OpenSSL APIs and details of OpenSSL data structures. What problem are you trying to solve?

&gt;<i> Can I use this one to set hostname/Ip address.?
</I>
Maybe. You haven't explained what you're trying to do.

&gt;<i> Can applications acting as both server and client set this?
</I>
It's set by a client. It doesn't matter what else that client is doing.
