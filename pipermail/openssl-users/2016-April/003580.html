That's interesting. I did attempt to do some research on who was
actually using this and came up with nothing recent, and no-one spoke up
for the engine when it was proposed that we drop it.

The good news is that support remains within the 1.0.2 version. Since
1.0.2 is a Long Term Support release, this means that a version of
OpenSSL will support ubsec until 31st December 2019.

If you must have it work in 1.1.0 and beyond then there is no reason why
you could not support this engine yourself in an external repo and have
it work with 1.1.0. I wouldn't think it would be that hard to do. Just
extract the code in the state that it was in at the point that the above
commit removed it. You will probably need to do some tweaks to get it to
build with subsequent changes (a number of structures have gone opaque
since then which probably means some adjustments will be needed). I can
give you some pointers with what needs to be done if that is the case.
Then you just need to build it as a .so and drop it into the
OPENSSL_ENGINES directory.
