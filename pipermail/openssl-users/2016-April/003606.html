There are a few ways of doing this:

1) Track it at the application protocol layer. For example read the
&quot;Content-Length&quot; HTTP header and wait until you've received that amount
of data. This is probably the best way. The other ways below only tell
you whether the network *currently* has any data to provide to you - not
whether the server has finished sending.

2) Use non-blocking IO

3) Check the underlying file descriptor to see if is readable at the
moment. So for example you can call BIO_get_fd(), and then call
&quot;select&quot;, or &quot;poll&quot; or similar on the file descriptor to see if it
readable. You may need to use SSL_pending()/SSL_has_pending() in
combination with this (see below).


&gt;<i> The relevant part is here:
</I>&gt;<i> 	for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
</I>&gt;<i> 		printf(&quot;calling BIO_write\n&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> 		r = BIO_write(bio, request, strlen(request));
</I>&gt;<i> 		printf(&quot;%i bytes written\n&quot;, r);
</I>&gt;<i> 		do {
</I>&gt;<i> 			printf(&quot;calling BIO_read\n&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> 			r = BIO_read(bio, buf, 1024);
</I>&gt;<i> 			printf(&quot;%i bytes read\n&quot;, r);
</I>&gt;<i> 		} while (r &gt; 0);
</I>&gt;<i> 	}
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now when I run this code it sends one write and reads a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> times. However when it's done BIO_read will block the program execution
</I>&gt;<i> and not return until a timeout.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I need a way to know that there's nothing to read before calling
</I>&gt;<i> BIO_read. Searching the docs I thought SSL_pending() might be what I
</I>&gt;<i> need. However it always returns zero, no matter if the server has
</I>&gt;<i> something to send or not.
</I>
SSL_pending() only tells you whether OpenSSL has read data from the
network and processed it, but has not yet provided it to you. This might
happen, for example if OpenSSL received a record of application data but
you only read part of it in the last SSL_read call. Compare with
SSL_has_pending() (only in 1.1.0).


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another sidenote: I have set the timeout of the context to 2, but it
</I>&gt;<i> still hangs for much longer, so the timeout value doesn't seem to have
</I>&gt;<i> any effect.
</I>
SSL_CTX_set_timeout() sets the timeout of the *session*. It has nothing
to do with the connection.
