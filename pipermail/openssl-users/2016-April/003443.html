<PRE>i guess the reason for my original post was that i was so taken aback by the 
fact that the body had so many red flags:
1.) '$1000': this list certainly is about money, but it would seem unlikely that 
actual terms not coupled with something like [loss|cost] or the like would seem 
improbable;
2.) 'giftcard': seems like a very unlikely discussion element here;
3.) 'shipment': ditto;
4.) 'informations' (sic): i realize this list -- being international in scope -- 
will not exhibit perfect English usage at all times (even from native English 
speakers). however, poor English (even just spell-checked) combined with other 
filters could push the score high enough;
5.) links: examples are always very constructive, but it is certainly not much 
of an inconvenience to limit active anchors to major sandboxes or even one 
operated by openssl; and
6.) obfuscation: the worst and most-telling is the fact the content clearly was 
designed to bypass filters by couching the desired message within a highly 
unusual number of non-prose, non-technical symbols. in this blatant case  there 
was a complete lack of prose and that will just never occur in this list.

this list is active, but a very low-volume one and more intensive body checks 
that route questionable entries to some monitoring box would seem to be well 
worth the small resource utilization required.

moreover, i do not notice anyone from google's security team(s) chiming in here 
and it would seem that good old 'otisevans98' will skate without consequence for 
the foray against this list which is entirely about security. perhaps added body 
filtering and actual human intervention would serve the desired benefit of 
having such intrusions actually result in an abuse complaint to the MTA 
operator.&lt;mailto:<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">otisevans98 at gmail.com</A>&gt;
