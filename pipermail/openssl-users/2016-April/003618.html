First of all: Before you continue speculating, my server is not doing
anything secret, just connect to it :-) (the one behind hboeck.de)

It's definitely chunking, if I manually connect via openssl s_client I
can see.

The reason is (as Rainer pointed out in a private mail) server side
includes used in the error pages. So it seems Apache's server side
includes implementation causes lots of small chunks.

This essentially means my error pages are serverd horribly inefficient.
However I think that doesn't matter too much, as they should only be
served on errors and errors should be hopefully scarce. This does not
happen with static content. Also with PHP content I still get chunked
encoding, but not these many small chunks.

I think we're getting pretty far away from openssl, so I hope nobody is
annoyed by offtopic discussion (and I think we can close it here), just
as people were speculating and it seemed to have generated quite
some interest I wanted to give a final answer what the cause was.
