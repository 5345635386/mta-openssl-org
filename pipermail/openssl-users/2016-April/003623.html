We are not getting that far off topic as this is also the
mailing list for the Apache mod_ssl module, which seems to
be closely involved with this inefficient behavior.

One could of cause speculate if the missing coalescing of
SSL records is a bug in mod_ssl or in some other part of
Apache httpd.

Enjoy
