</I>Depends if any relying parties are checking old signatures &quot;as of&quot;
some securely recorded date of receiving the signature.

In that case, they will still need to be able to see, in the latest
CRL, if and when a (now expired) certificate was revoked before it
expired.  This is also the reason it can be important to add a
&quot;backdated&quot; revocation to a CRL, e.g. if a breach of a private key
has been detected as happening around a specific time.  As always
there is the fundamental issue of deciding if the party reporting
loss of a private key is lying to deny responsibility for something
that was recently signed by that party.

So I would not remove actual revocations from CRL lists, but would
instead rotate issuing intermediary certificates such that a new
intermediary (with its own CRL) is introduced a few times/year.
   Some time after all certificates issued by an old intermediary
expire, but before the intermediary itself expires, it should sign
a &quot;final&quot; CRL that doesn't expire.


Enjoy
