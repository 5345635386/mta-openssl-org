</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Thanks a lot for your responses. Probably I should have rephrased my
question to make it sound clearer. In the flow of the paper, the technique
to determine the top 2-3 bits was introduced before the binary search
algorithm (which I understand). What is still not so clear to me what or
how they &quot;try out top 2-3 bits&quot;. Assuming we are trying out top 2 bits, I
assume that 'g' is constructed as follows:

    - Set the two most significant bits to each one in the set =&gt; {00, 01,
10, 11}, one after another
    - For each of the above cases, fill the remaining 510 bits with *some*
bits (are those assumed to be all zero bits?)

My first doubt is, what will the remaining 510 bits of initial guess 'g'
be? Determining the starting point is where I am struggling at the moment.
Once I know the top bits, I perfectly understand how the i-th bit is
extracted given top (i-1) bits are already known.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Q: What will the remaining bits be in this case?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A: In what case? At this point in the algorithm you don't know them. You
</I>&gt;<i> iterate the steps of the algorithm until you know, based on timing
</I>&gt;<i> differences, that the more-significant half of the bits in your g match
</I>&gt;<i> those in q (with high probability). Then, as the paper says, you use
</I>&gt;<i> Coppersmith's algorithm to finish the factorization. (It's been a long time
</I>&gt;<i> since I looked at Coppersmith's algorithm, so I forget how it works and
</I>&gt;<i> what constraints there are on it.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the side-channel attacks I can think of offhand do this sort of
</I>&gt;<i> bit-at-a-time extraction, by the way (which gives them logarithmic time
</I>&gt;<i> complexity obviously; note B&amp;B characterize it as a &quot;binary search&quot;). So if
</I>&gt;<i> you're learing about side-channel attacks expect to see more of this.
