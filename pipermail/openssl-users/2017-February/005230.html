This does look like the client is misbehaving for some reason. It's not
behaviour I can reproduce with a 1.0.1j version of s_client.

The second ClientHello should have a TLS1.2 record version, not have the
SCSV ciphersuite, but instead have a renegotiation_info extension.

Is the second ClientHello encrypted or in plaintext? If it is a
renegotiation then it would be encrypted. I am wondering whether for
some reason the client has forgotten its original connection, and is
attempting a second completely new TLS connection over the same
underlying TCP connection.
