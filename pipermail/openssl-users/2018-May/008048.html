<PRE>Greetings

Currently down here in the land down under, the Defence Trade Controls 
Act 2012 (Cth) is currently under going an independent review by Dr 
Vivian Thom AM. Responses by stake holders is due by close of business, 
31st of May, 2018 as per the guidelines and submission requirements set 
out @

<A HREF="http://www.defence.gov.au/publications/reviews/tradecontrols/Default.asp">http://www.defence.gov.au/publications/reviews/tradecontrols/Default.asp</A>

[ That includes the DSGL listing of cryptology as 'Duel-Use' technology 
]

&lt;--

Overview

The Defence Trade Controls Act introduced offences which commenced 
operation on 2 April 2016 for the unauthorised supply, and in certain 
instances publication, of defence technology, and for the brokering of 
defence goods and technology without a permit. The Act also provided for 
a review of its operation to begin as soon as possible after 2 April 
2018.
The review will include an assessment of whether the Act is fit for 
purpose, particularly whether it adequately safeguards national defence 
capability and prevents trade and collaboration that could unwittingly 
advance the military capabilities of potential adversaries. The Review 
will also identify gaps in the Act&#8217;s controls, any unintended 
consequences arising from the Act, such as unnecessary regulatory 
burden, and other relevant matters.

Consultation

Interested parties are invited to submit written comment during the 
consultation period. The closing date for submissions is 31 May 2018.

While submissions may be made electronically or by post, electronic 
lodgement is preferred.

Submissions will be published on this website as they are received.

submissions will be uploaded to this website and publicly available, 
unless you indicate you would like all or part of your submission to 
remain in confidence. Automatically generated confidentiality statements 
in emails do not suffice for this purpose. Respondents who would like 
all or part of their submission to remain in confidence should provide 
this information marked as such in a separate attachment. The 
Secretariat may edit submissions before publishing where they contain 
offensive material.

The Department is required to comply with the Freedom of Information Act 
1982 (FOI Act) and any submissions provided for the review may be the 
subject of an FOI request. The FOI Act includes various exemptions for 
disclosing information, including where material was provided in

for access to submissions will be handled in accordance with the FOI 
Act.

holders containing a number of high level case studies regarding 
'FooCrypt,0.0.1,Core | FooCrypt, A Tale Of Cynical Cyclical 
Encryption.'.

This is an informal request to the openssl community to see if other 
community members have experienced issues which could be included in a 
case study along with our response into Dr Thom.

If any members of the openssl community wish to provide information for 
a case study submission via the FooCrypt submission, please do so by 
close of business [ 17:30 hours ], 30th of May, 2018 AEST, so that a 
summarised overview of the attachments can be performed.

Please note that it is the intent to provide the information in an 'as 
is' state from what we receive via email.

Please provide a pdf document containing the information you wish to 
pass onto Dr Thom.

Each pdf document will be summarised as a simple table of index.

          Author : Date : Location : Document Number.

submission.

Response can be submitted to : <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">openssl at foocrypt.net</A> or
