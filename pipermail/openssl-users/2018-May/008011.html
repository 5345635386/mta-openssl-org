And yet TCP itself moves ACKs when there's no window available.

TLS could (but as far as I can tell does not) have such a mechanism.&#160; It
could have a window, like TCP, where the receiver would say &quot;you can
send me 64K of data&quot;, and the sender wouldn't be allowed to send data
(but could send control messages) when that window is exhausted, until
the receiver reopens the window.&#160; It could have control messages like
XON and XOFF that say &quot;please stop sending me data (but control is OK)&quot;
and &quot;resume sending data&quot;.

Each scheme has its problems (mostly around how much data can be in
flight at any one time), but they're both clearly possible.

It does seem like some sort of flow control would be desirable, so that
the receiver doesn't have to have some way to handle arbitrarily large
amounts of data to keep the connection healthy.

Maybe in TLS 1.4.
