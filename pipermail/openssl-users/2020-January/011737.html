It sounds like you're directly encrypting data with RSA.  That's a
mistake.  RSA is for decrypting a symmetric algorithm key, that then
decrypts the data.

Sorry, 0.6 seconds for a single 1024-bit RSA_private_decrypt() (128
bytes of data) is not plausible, but you say you have just over 8KB of
data, which would take ~65 calls to RSA_private_decrypt() to decrypt
piecewise.  It sure looks like you're measuring something other than
what you claim to be measuring, or not describing it accurately.

On my laptop RSA_private_decrypt (aka sign) takes 135 microseconds.  You
claim 600 milliseconds for perhaps ~60 calls, which might be 10ms each,
but that still is about two orders of magnitude too slow.

So, sorry whatever you're measuring, it is not the performance of
RSA_private_decrypt().

&gt;<i> While I'm ok with the execution speed with OpenSSL 1.0.2, I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> figure out why the times doubled with OpenSSL 1.1.1.  
</I>
Neither is a reasonable performance level, but also it is not reasonable
to use RSA for bulk data encryption.

&gt;<i> I'm logging times before and after the calls to RSA_private_decrypt.
</I>
How many calls?  What else is happening to feed the data into the
decryption algorithm, and reassemble the output?

&gt;<i> With OpenSSL 1.0.2 it takes on average about 4-8 milliseconds for each
</I>&gt;<i> RSA_private_decrypt call.  With OpenSSL 1.1.1d, it takes 10-15
</I>&gt;<i> milliseconds for each RSA_private_decrypt call.
</I>
Now we see that you're in fact chunking data for multiple calls to
&quot;decrypt&quot; via RSA.  That's a fatal design flaw. This is not a valid
operating mode for RSA.  You MUST NOT do this.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I'm wondering if perhaps my build configuration is incorrect or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; missing something for the 1.1.1d build.  Here are the configuration 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; parameters for the 64-bit build:
</I>
You have a deeper problem, your use of RSA is broken.

&gt;<i> The data being decrypted is local on the client machine and is just an XML file. 
</I>&gt;<i> RSA key is 1024 bits.  
</I>&gt;<i> I'm using OAEP padding.
</I>
This is a mistake, for asymmetric encryption you should be using CMS.

&gt;<i> Thank you for the information.  I removed it from the configuration
</I>&gt;<i> parameters.  I didn't really notice a difference in execution time
</I>&gt;<i> though.  I also removed the no-asm parameter, setup nasm, and rebuilt
</I>&gt;<i> with no noticeable changes.  
</I>
Likely the time is dominated by something other than the RSA operations,
but since those are mistake anyway, it hardly matters.

&gt;<i> &gt; I logged things granular enough to see the speed difference was in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; RSA_private_decrypt, but I'm not sure why it is so much slower with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.1.1d.  Any help or ideas would be appreciated!
</I>
STOP.  Fix your design to use CMS.  Report any performance differences
in CMS between 1.0.2 and 1.1.1 when built correctly with asm support.

&gt;<i> &gt;At 600ms for 8KB, it is not plausible that the time is spend doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cryptography.  That's barely fast enough to feed a 1980's modem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would expect the execution times to be more in line with what I saw
</I>&gt;<i> with Linux for both 1.0.2 and 1.1.1.  But even so, I do not understand
</I>&gt;<i> why just upgrading to 1.1.1 causes the RSA_private_decrypt calls to
</I>&gt;<i> double in execution time from what they were with 1.0.2?
</I>
I would expect execution times that are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude
faster, especially if you were using sound cryptographic primitives.
