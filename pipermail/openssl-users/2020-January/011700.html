OpenSSL has a default cert store path, but it is up to applications to request use of the default paths for certificate validation.  Many do, some don't.

Is this a Linux machine or a Windows machine?  You're using backslash as a path separator, which is not something that Works on POSIX systems (e.g. Linux).

&gt;<i> Is it ok to remove \usr\lib\ssl\certs\ca-bundle.crt file if we don't use this?
</I>
You can remove whatever you want, but if it is installed by an OS package, something might break if you do.

This question is best asked of your Linux vendor, the upstream OpenSSL project does not bundle any trusted certificates.
