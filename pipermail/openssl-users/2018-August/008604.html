</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for responding here.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have been preparing an Internet Draft on how to build an ED25519 pki.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I know have the choice of:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> building my own 1.1.1 pre9 for testing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Wait to push the draft out until 1.1.1 is fully released.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Fudge the draft by adding yet another caveat (yes there is a caveat
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> section that I developed in creating the ECDSA pki draft) that the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> commands are for how it is suppose to work in production 1.1.1, not what
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I had to do in the prerelease.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Decisions decisions.  Thing is I want the draft out so I can push for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> EDDSA support in IEEE 802.1AR with the next meeting early Sept.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure if providing command line examples for one particular tool
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are a good idea...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Example certificates, sure, but not commands to generate them...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;We can't test out the security part of the protocol because we cannot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get certificates&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;We ran our tests with security disable because we could not afford the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cost and time for a test pki.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;We did test with RSA certificates from vendor A.&quot; (and they were using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> old libs that would not support ecdsa, but marketed it as such.)&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Over the years and in protocol design development, I have heard too many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we can't.  So I set about with, &quot;here is one way.&quot;  Since then I have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had a few people actually thank me for making it possible for them to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> build an ecdsa pki for their product testing needs.  Just one justifies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my effort.
</I>&gt;<i> well, I see nothing wrong with providing documentation and how-to's, I just
</I>&gt;<i> don't see that it should be elevated to an Internet Draft level...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> by its very nature it needs to be constantly updated, so having it in a static
</I>&gt;<i> RFC is contrary to that
</I>
that is the value of Internet Drafts that many of us IETFers have 
figured out.&#160; draft versions can just keep on going and the tools will 
take you to the current draft.&#160; IDs have become neat working documents, 
though there is more github work coming along.&#160; More workgroups are 
doing requirements docs that will never be published as RFCs; they will 
stay as IDs.&#160; Much better source of why did the wg do? than plow through 
the old mailing list archives.&#160; The IESG is actually encouraging such a 
use of IDs.

&gt;<i> now, for generating testing certificates (and what's more important, the whole
</I>&gt;<i> PKI) we are using this script to provide sensible defaults and easy way to
</I>&gt;<i> generate certificates with just few options departing from those defaults:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/redhat-qe-security/certgen">https://github.com/redhat-qe-security/certgen</A>
</I>
I will take a look at this.&#160; It did not come up in my google searches a 
year ago.&#160; Guess just not asking the right question or github is 
protected from google...

&gt;<i> to get a PKI you run those commands:
</I>&gt;<i> source certgen/lib.sh
</I>&gt;<i> x509KeyGen ca
</I>&gt;<i> x509KeyGen server
</I>&gt;<i> x509SelfSign ca
</I>&gt;<i> x509CertSign --CA ca server
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The private key file will be printed by use of:
</I>&gt;<i> x509Key server
</I>&gt;<i> to get certificate file name you run:
</I>&gt;<i> x509Cert server
</I>
In testing situations I have been in, intermediate CAs, revocation, the 
like are needed.

Plus getting more interest in 802.1AR certs with vendors (can't get 
certs to test out my product design).

&gt;<i> (easy switches are also provided to get DER files or PKCS#12 files instead of
</I>&gt;<i> the default PEM format)
</I>
I will be interested to see how you handle DER, as I found cases where 
the command line was broken.&#160; Read my caveat section.&#160; In some cases you 
have to make the file in PEM then convert to DER.&#160; Plus there is no DER 
way to handle cert chains as was discussed here a year ago.&#160; So I will 
be interested to see how you handle cert chains non-PEM.

&gt;<i> to get ecdsa certificate, you just need to change one of the above lines
</I>&gt;<i> with x509KeyGen to have `-t ecdsa` specified. Want RSA-PSS certificate? do `-t
</I>&gt;<i> rsa-pss`.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See runtest.sh for other examples.
</I>
I will take a look.

&gt;<i> It is compatible with all versions of openssl since RHEL-4 (so 0.9.7), if a
</I>&gt;<i> given feature is supported in that version of openssl.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (while ed25519 support is not yet there, it will be in few weeks, I was
</I>&gt;<i> running just basic tests of it, without involving full PKI)
</I>
Nice.&#160; See <A HREF="https://github.com/rgmhtt/draft-moskowitz-ecdsa-pki">https://github.com/rgmhtt/draft-moskowitz-ecdsa-pki</A>

I am right now adding an algorithm variable to support ed488.

This actually does not work right with 1.1.1-pre9, as PR 6901 did not 
make that build, so I have to do my command and .cnf patches still.&#160; If 
I publish prior to 9/11 (2nd day of Rosh Hashana, so I won't be doing 
any work the beginning of next week), I will have to include text (that 
a later draft version will remove) about this caveat.&#160; Given what I have 
to do this week, I will probably not publish until middle of next week.&#160; 
IEEE 802.1 will be meeting in Oslo, so I will be working remotely to get 
a PAR going to rev 802.1AR to support EDDSA based on my work.&#160; Now there 
is a standards org that has real challenges with advances like this.&#160; 
802.1AR-2018 only supports RSA and ECDSA p256 and p384.
