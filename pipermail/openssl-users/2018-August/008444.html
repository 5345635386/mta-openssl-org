<PRE>[...] The other party MUST respond with a close_notify alert of its own and
close down the connection immediately, *discarding any pending writes*.

I've read this before, but I've also checked the sources of SSL_write and
they seem contradictory:

SSL_write does not return with error when SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN is set, but
does so when SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN is set. Why is this? A minor bug? If the RFC
states the end who receives a close_notify should *discard any pending
writes* then it surely seems a bug to allow SSL_write for a connection
where SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN is set?

....

&gt;<i> If your question is whether you can still read any data that may have
</I>been in flight when you send your close_notify, I believe the answer
is no.  Further data received from the peer is discarded after a
close_notify is sent.

I also believe so, especially since SSL_shutdown docs seem to hint that
once SSL_shutdown is called, it should be called again until fully done
(serving SSL_WANT_READ/WRITE as needed). In other words, SSL_shutdown
becomes the only function called until the SSL connection is fully closed,
no more SSL_read is called and thus it cannot report any received data.
SSL_shutdown does not return with any data.

Regarding the SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN - do you think this is a minor bug?

</I>&gt;<i> TLS *does not* support half-closed connections (RFC5246):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    close_notify
</I>&gt;<i>       This message notifies the recipient that the sender will not send
</I>&gt;<i>       any more messages on this connection.  Note that as of TLS 1.1,
</I>&gt;<i>       failure to properly close a connection no longer requires that a
</I>&gt;<i>       session not be resumed.  This is a change from TLS 1.0 to conform
</I>&gt;<i>       with widespread implementation practice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Either party may initiate a close by sending a close_notify alert.
</I>&gt;<i>    Any data received after a closure alert is ignored.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Unless some other fatal alert has been transmitted, each party is
</I>&gt;<i>    required to send a close_notify alert before closing the write side
</I>&gt;<i>    of the connection.  The other party MUST respond with a close_notify
</I>&gt;<i>    alert of its own and close down the connection immediately,
</I>&gt;<i>    discarding any pending writes.  It is not required for the initiator
</I>&gt;<i>    of the close to wait for the responding close_notify alert before
</I>&gt;<i>    closing the read side of the connection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    If the application protocol using TLS provides that any data may be
</I>&gt;<i>    carried over the underlying transport after the TLS connection is
</I>&gt;<i>    closed, the TLS implementation must receive the responding
</I>&gt;<i>    close_notify alert before indicating to the application layer that
</I>&gt;<i>    the TLS connection has ended.  If the application protocol will not
</I>&gt;<i>    transfer any additional data, but will only close the underlying
</I>&gt;<i>    transport connection, then the implementation MAY choose to close the
</I>&gt;<i>    transport without waiting for the responding close_notify.  No part
</I>&gt;<i>    of this standard should be taken to dictate the manner in which a
</I>&gt;<i>    usage profile for TLS manages its data transport, including when
</I>&gt;<i>    connections are opened or closed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Note: It is assumed that closing a connection reliably delivers
</I>&gt;<i>    pending data before destroying the transport.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If your question is whether you can still read any data that may have
</I>&gt;<i> been in flight when you send your close_notify, I believe the answer
