Multiblock works by sending multiple TLS records to be encrypted in one
go - either 4 or 8 records depending on how much data you send in one
go. Basically it looks at the amount of data you passed to SSL_write()
and sees how many records it needs to divide it up into (with a record
being max_send_fragment bytes long; by default max_send_fragment is 16k
although you can change that value). If there are at least 4 records
worth of data then multiblock will be used (assuming the negotiated
ciphersuite supports it).

A stream of small records like you describe would not satisfy the above
criteria, so multi-block would not kick in.

Unfortunately not, no. However it depends on what you are trying to
achieve. If you just want to use the built-in ciphersuites that support
this then you need to:
1) Make sure you are on a platform that supports it (IIRC AESNI support
is required for these to work - Andy Polyakov can probably clarify)
2) Ensure TLS negotiates a multiblock capable ciphersuite
3) Ensure your application sends sufficient data in one go for
multi-block to kick in

If you satisfy all of the above then no API is required. It should just
work.

If, on the other hand, you want to implement a new cipher that supports
multiblock then you will probably want to do it as an engine and use the
implementations of e_aes_cbc_hmac_sha1.c and e_aes_cbc_hmac_sha256.c as
a guide. Ciphers that implement multiblock need to be TLS &quot;aware&quot;, in
that they must output the appropriate record headers too. If you're
going down this route then I'd like to point out the similar facility
that we have in OpenSSL 1.1.0 known as pipelining:

<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/ssl/SSL_set_max_pipelines.html">https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/ssl/SSL_set_max_pipelines.html</A>

This gives you a bit more control over how the data is split up into
records and the ciphers do not need to be TLS aware. Also both
encryption and decryption is supported. However there are no built-in
ciphersuites that use this as yet.
