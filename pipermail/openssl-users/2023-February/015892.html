I see, you're continuing to use nsCertType, despite its entering its 3rd
decade of obsolescence. :-)  In that case, yes, OpenSSL still has code
to honour these, and will return:

    X509_V_ERR_INVALID_PURPOSE

on failure.  The error string for that is:

    &quot;unsuitable certificate purpose&quot;

but your application may be reporting it using its own mapping.

&gt;<i> This particular code set was used a number of years (and many OpenSSL 
</I>&gt;<i> releases) back and didn't complain about this; its not a big deal to 
</I>&gt;<i> issue the certs this way for the connecting client endpoints, but I was 
</I>&gt;<i> more than a bit surprised when I got the rejections, since the keyUsage

</I>
The sane (non deprecated) thing to do is to never set nsCertType, and
set just EKUs.
