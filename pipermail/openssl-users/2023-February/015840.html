<PRE>Dear OpenSSL users,

I'm currently developing an OpenSSL provider (so I'm using OpenSSL 
versions 3.0 and newer, currently self compiled 3.1.0-beta2-dev). One 
key feature of the provider will be providing client certificates (from 
my providers store) to servers upon request during TLS.

I've implemented decoder, keymgmt, signature and store functionalities.

To quote documentation from `SSL_CTX_set_client_cert_cb`, &quot;When a 
certificate was set using the SSL_CTX_use_certificate(3) family of 
functions, it will be sent to the server.&quot;. I've used 
`SSL_CTX_load_verify_store()` which I believe suffices.

Unfortunately none of my functions get called afterward when dealing 
with the client certificate. And by that I mean that my store isn't 
opened to see if I have matching certificates.

I've tried to circumvent this behavior with 
`SSL_CTX_set_client_cert_cb()` where I load the certificate and key 
manually, but to no avail. None of my implemented functions get called 
and when looking at the stack trace I get lost really fast since there 
is some caching happening. I'm suspicious that my functions don't get 
called in this case because I have not implemented digest 
functionalities. Since the last trace output I get is &quot;Using client 
verify alg SHA2-256&quot;. (Although I get that output even when not using 
custom client certificate callback).

So my question is: What needs to be implemented/changed/called so 
OpenSSL will use certificates from my providers store as client 
certificates?

Any help would be strongly appreciated.
Ladislav Marko
