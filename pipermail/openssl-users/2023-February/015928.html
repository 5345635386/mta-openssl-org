Or just standard UNIX close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC), depending on what OP means by &quot;unprivileged child task&quot;.

&gt;<i> More likely, the OpenSSH child is closing all unneeded file

</I>&gt;<i> Or you need to open the FD again.
</I>
Yes. OP wrote &quot;tries to open my device file&quot;, but from the problem description it seems more accurate to say that the &quot;child task&quot; is inheriting an EVP_CIPHER_CTX and passing that to EVP_CipherInit, and the descriptor opened by the provider under EVP_CIPHER_CTX_new has been closed. Reopening the device file as necessary seems like the better option.

In fact, it's a good idea to check that the descriptor still refers to your device anyway, e.g. by using fstat and checking the device and inode numbers match values you memoized when you opened it. It's not safe for libraries to assume descriptors they have allocated remain open unless that's part of the API contract (and it isn't here, because OpenSSL providers are transparent to callers), and because UNIX requires reusing the lowest available descriptor, it may well have been closed and reopened as something else.

Sorry for the confusion. This is during OpenSSH authentication, a child process which does not have any privileges (e.g. file open)  and it is supposed to do the authentication, that means it calls Libcrypto Cipher functions. In this case even file reopen won't work since process has no privileges to do this. 

 Is it mentioned or anyone attempted how OpenSSL supposed to handle this case ?

Thanks,
Hareesh
