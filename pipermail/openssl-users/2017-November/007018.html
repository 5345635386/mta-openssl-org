That, and many applications will reasonably disagree on what an appropriate default is.

</I>
But some other people would not prefer compatibility problems.

There are a great many OpenSSL consumers. Making radical changes to the default behavior of the API would break many applications - and so it's likely those applications would stop updating their OpenSSL builds.

&gt;<i> Having per-user or system-wide configuration files that are consulted under the covers would help,
</I>
For many applications, no, it really wouldn't. It would be a huge mess.

&gt;<i> since then the user could revert to less-secure settings without needing the application source.
</I>
If the application is well-written, the user doesn't need the application source now. If the application isn't well-written, being able to change &quot;settings&quot; is not one of your bigger problems.

&gt;<i> Maybe have the &quot;create handle&quot; function take an application name as an argument, so that individual applications
</I>&gt;<i> could be managed separately.
</I>
And we have another namespace problem. No thanks.

&gt;<i> Looking at it another way:&#160; browsers manage to do it...
</I>
Manage to do what, exactly? And how are browsers a good model for the vast range of OpenSSL applications? They're just one type of client that nearly always uses a very particular PKI model.

Not all the world's a VAX.
