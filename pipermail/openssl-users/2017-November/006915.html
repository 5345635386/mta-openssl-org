</I>&gt;<i> We have an embedded device which will be loaded with a public key for validating data signatures.  We identify this key by means of its SHA-1 fingerprint; to do this we have implemented a custom X509_LOOKUP_METHOD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The lookup, performed via X509_LOOKUP_by_fingerprint works great, that is at least when we call X509_STORE_load_locations with a file identifying the certificate file directly.  Our problem begins when I wish to create a store using the directory that contains our data signing certificates.  My hope was to identify the relevant certificate by fingerprint and return the X509* to be used in validating the certificate itself against a separate Root/Intermediate store and then the verify signature itself by retrieving the key from the certificate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sadly, it seems that X509_STORE_load_locations does not automatically populate the object cache with the certificates contained in the directory.  It appears this may be by design and not an issue with our code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Is there any way to have OpenSSL automatically populate the cache with the certificates in the directory?
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  In the source code, I can see that X509_STORE_get1_certs will go off and call X509_STORE_get_by_subject and potentially load the certificates from the directory based on their subject.  Will I need to implement the equivalent of this in order to load certificates from the directory by fingerprint?
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  Is there anything particularly wrong with this approach?  It seemed odd to me that OpenSSL itself does not implement the fingerprint lookup itself.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>The by-directory method is designed to avoid keeping the entire collection
of trusted certificate in memory, and to avoid slowing down program startup
with the time to load all the certificates.&#160; Because the main use is to
find the issuer of a certificate received from another computer, the
directory contains certificate files whose name is an 8-digit checksum of
the subject referenced by other certificate, with a file extensions being
simply a counter from 0 to the number of certificates with a duplicate hash
value.

For your use of finding certificates by weak certificate hash (SHA-1 is
being phased out of this world as quickly as possible), the options are to
either write a script that symlinks from the first 10 hex digits of the
SHA-1 hash (with similar collision-counting extension) and write your own
lookup code, or to write a function to load all the certificates either by
looping over the directory or using a traditional all-certs-in-one-file
like ca-certificates.crt.

However unless you have a hard requirement to start from the SHA-1
&quot;fingerprint&quot;, it is probably a lot easier to just change your code to
identify the certificate by a &quot;friendly name&quot;, which would simple be the
filename without directory and .pem extension.&#160; For example
&quot;ValiCert_Class_1_VA&quot; as input loading 
/etc/ssl/certs/ValiCert_Class_1_VA.pem .


Enjoy
