 &gt; &gt; That said, it wouldn't hurt for the OMC to post a message to the list stating
&gt;<i> &gt; that business will continue as planned, since two very key figures have left

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have two reactions, just my personal view.  First, it&#8217;s premature to say
</I>&gt;<i> anything, we&#8217;re still figuring things out. Second, what open source project
</I>&gt;<i> can guarantee that things will continue as they were after people left?  Or
</I>&gt;<i> the larger question, what guarantees can any project really make?
</I>
That's fair. And on further consideration I'll withdraw the &quot;to the list&quot; part.

I can't speak for Jakob, of course. I was surprised to learn of the blog posts, because I hadn't been following the blog; if I knew it existed at some point, I'd forgotten. But I'm following it now.

It probably wouldn't hurt to post something to the lists when there's a blog post with news like this  - items that subscribers would likely feel is important. Blog posts like the recent &quot;OpenSSL in China&quot; series probably don't need to be mentioned on the lists. But it's subjective, and I wouldn't want to create more work for anyone.
