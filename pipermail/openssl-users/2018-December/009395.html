</I>Peter Gutman, for all his talents, dislikes PKI with a vengeance.

EV is a standard for OV certificates done right.&#160; Which involves more
thorough identity checks, stricter rules for the CAs to follow etc.

The real point of EV certificates is to separate CAs that do a good
job from those that do a more sloppy job, without completely distrusting
the mediocre CA operations.

Due to market forces, the good CAs also offer the weaker certificate
types at a lower price to compete with the mediocre CAs that are aren't
good/thorough enough to do the full job.

The way EV certs are highlighted in Browsers (Green bar etc.) was a way
to create market demand for the higher quality.&#160; They could be indicated
in some other useful way of cause, but the distinguishment between &quot;The
CA did something to check the name and real world address in the
certificate&quot; (OV) versus &quot;The CA checked the name and and real world
address thoroughly in accordance with the higher quality standard&quot; (EV)
is still of some significance.

If you look at that long list of CA roots preinstalled in a typical
browser, only a minority are authorized, trusted and audited to issue
to the higher EV standard.
