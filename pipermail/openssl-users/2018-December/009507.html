To avoid trusted CAs, you have to load both a private key *and*
a self-signed certificate.  While certificate-less TLS is in
theory possible with RFC7250 bare public keys, in practice no
libraries I know of support this.

Also, your CA does not have to be a third-party CA, you can generate
your trusted issuer CA, its private key can be &quot;off-line&quot;, making
recovery from server key compromise somewhat simpler, but with so
few systems in scope the difference is minor.

&gt;<i> As far as I understand the mechanism that would only enable encryption,

</I>
Again, that's not the case, but you still need a certificate to go
with that key.  In the simplest case that certificate can be
self-signed, and would be the only one (or one of a few) trusted
by the verifier (via suitable settings of CAfile and CApath).

&gt;<i> &gt; they are both quite strong, use 128-bit to optimize for speed or

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, I've been told that AES256 is weaker than AES128 in theory, 
</I>&gt;<i> and have been discouraged to use it.
</I>
There are some concerns about the key schedule, but they've not
panned out to attacks that make AES256 weaker than AES128.

&gt;<i> &gt; and you could use Ed25519 certificates and/or X25519 key exchange.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I said I'd like to avoid using any certificates. I don't see the point

</I>
You're going to have (self-signed) certificates.  They're essentially
slightly bloated key containers.

&gt;<i> And certificates, from my limited understanding, only establish external
</I>&gt;<i> trust anyways. I want direct trust.
</I>
Certificates do not preclude direct trust.  Self-signed certificates do
not entail any outside parties.  A suitable self-signed certificate and
private key can be generated via:

    $ temp=$(mktemp chain.XXXXXXX)
    $ openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /dev/stdout \
	-x509 -subj / -days 36524 &gt;&gt; $temp &amp;&amp; mv $temp self-chain.pem

I think that password protection for the keys is a waste of time,
but if you can use it if you wish.

    $ temp=$(mktemp chain.XXXXXXX)
    $ openssl genrsa -aes128 -out $temp 2048
    $ openssl req -new -key $temp -x509 -subj / -days 36524 &gt;&gt; $temp &amp;&amp;
	mv $temp self-chain.pem
