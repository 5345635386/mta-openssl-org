<PRE>Thanks for the quick response Rich!

Just a quick follow on.

Per RFC6960 for OCSP, there are 3 options:

   All definitive response messages SHALL be digitally signed.  The key

   used to sign the response MUST belong to one of the following:



   - the CA who issued the certificate in question



   - a Trusted Responder whose public key is trusted by the requestor



   - a CA Designated Responder (Authorized Responder, defined in

     Section 4.2.2.2&lt;<A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960#section-4.2.2.2">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960#section-4.2.2.2</A>&gt;) who holds a specially marked certificate issued

     directly by the CA, indicating that the responder may issue OCSP

     responses for that CA

I&#8217;m seeing the self-signed and/or even a separate PKI root or hierarchy that is designated to sign responses as the 2nd option above which is essentially an &#8216;out of band&#8217; trust that is configured on the requestor ahead of time.  Are you saying option 2 from the RFC is not supported within OpenSSL and would require changes?  Or am I misinterpreting option 2 above.

Lastly, I assuming my understanding is correct, I was thinking X509_check_trust() allows for communicating this &#8216;out of band&#8217; trust to OpenSSL for validation of OCSP responses, is this not what this trust setting is for?

Thanks,
Animesh

Subject: Re: [openssl-users] OCSP response signed by self-signed trusted responder validation

The responder isn&#8217;t supposed to be self-signed.  It&#8217;s supposed to be signed by the CA issuing the certs.  That way you know that the CA &#8220;trusts&#8221; the responder.

Now, having said that, what you want to do is reasonable &#8211; think of it as &#8220;out of band&#8221; trust.  You will probably have to modify the source to support it, however.
