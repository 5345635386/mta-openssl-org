</I>No, Uri you get it wrong.&#160; Different levels of certainty is the
point.

Consider it like this:

DV: A regular printed business card that you can get from a
 &#160; vending machine, proves very little.
 &#160; &#160; The CA just checks that the person or robot requesting the
 &#160; certificate has some semblance of control over the domain
 &#160; name at the time of issuance.&#160; Price is as low as $0.

OV: A debit card with the supposed owners name on it, available
 &#160; from a number of companies that do minimal checking, but still
 &#160; a better ID proof than a business card.
 &#160; &#160; The CA must check that the company name and address are true,
 &#160; using some basic steps such as checking that a company by that
 &#160; name exists at that address and confirms they are the ones
 &#160; requesting the certificate.&#160; There is no check that the company
 &#160; name is an official name or that the company has a business
 &#160; license etc.&#160; A traditional lemonade stand run by children can
 &#160; potentially get an OV certificate if they stay in one place for
 &#160; the time it takes to get the certificate.&#160; (A CA agent visiting
 &#160; the company site is enough checking of company existence for OV).

EV: A proper photo ID with serious identity checking before being
 &#160; issued, like a government passport.&#160; Includes the holders
 &#160; legal name and government ID number (literally), which can be
 &#160; used to look up the subjects legal status.
 &#160; &#160; The CA must check public records, and do some hard checks that
 &#160; the request is officially from that company.&#160; There is a 50+
 &#160; pages official specification listing how every tidbit of
 &#160; this information must be checked.&#160; The CA cannot limit
 &#160; its own liability for certain failures to less than $2000.

Each step up the ladder gives the user more certainty the
person/website is who it says it is, but is more expensive
and difficult to obtain for the person/website.&#160; Each step also
costs more money for the CA to check, because there is more work
to do.

The &quot;make it look green&quot; and &quot;fights crime&quot; slogans were just
the old marketing campaign, repeated endlessly as a more
efficient sales pressure than the real explanation.


&gt;<i> While the point of EV was that it certified a binding to a (domain + business name)
</I>&gt;<i> rather than just a domain with DV, it turned out that displaying the business name
</I>&gt;<i> was also subject to abuse, and the security gain proved elusive.
