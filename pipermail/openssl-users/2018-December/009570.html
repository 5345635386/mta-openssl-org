<PRE>I do not want to complicate matters further, but there needs to be one
thing clear here: this library is mainly developed and maintained by
/volunteers/. They're putting in time and effort to improve the state of
the crypto ecosystem, and they seem to be doing a damn good job at it, as
even you, yourself, said that (paraphrasing massively) this is the best
choice of crypto library out there.

I am not one of those &quot;it doesn't matter what you say, but how you say it&quot;
people, but the way you have presented your (valid or invalid; I am not one
to say) arguments has changed the perception of yourself in the eyes of
quite a few people (by mailing list metrics) thus far. I'd bet that you'd
have a much better time getting your points across if you at least tried to
be more civil in your arguments, and that you'd attract many more useful
and free replies, as opposed to the ones trying to avoid further conflict
you're getting now.

Lastly, you are definitely free to submit patches and file issues for
anything you deem wrong, bad, insecure or unacceptable in the codebase; it
is a much more constructive way of helping both yourself and people who
might run into the same problems later down the line.

Regards,
Matt
