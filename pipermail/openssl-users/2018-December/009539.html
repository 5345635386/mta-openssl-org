<PRE>
A major way in which PKCS7 and CMS signed artifacts differ is that
the CMS artifacts include a content-type.

RFC5652 has a decision tree to decide what version of SignedData
structure to produce.  The presence of a non-&quot;id-data&quot; content-type
is among the decision tree, and so I understand why it can't be set after the
signature (besides, the content-type is within the signature!).

I think it's probably too complex that the only way to set the content-type
is by doing the CMS_PARTIAL work.   I think that CMS_sign() and CMS_encrypt()
ought to take a eContentType OID: but ABI issues would mean a new call.

I had to read the source code to understand the difference between
CMS_get0_type() and CMS_get0_eContentType().

I can see how one refers to the cms-&gt;contentType, and the other refers to
the same thing &quot;as received&quot;, in the structure (RFC5652's
EncapsulatedContentInfo).   I'm not sure if there is intended to be
functional or API contract differences between the two??

I was also mystified about get0_content(), until I realized that it did not
have the word &quot;type&quot; in it.  I've sent some pull requests, one of which
suggests that you can't call get0_content() until CMS_final() has been called
on outgoing objects.

CMS_get0_content() returns a pointer to a pointer, and it says down at the
bottom that it can be used to modify the content.  It's clear that a
receiver (verifier/decrypter) can mutate this content as part of it's
processing: saves memory for a buffer, a copy, and a potential buffer
overflow, I guess.

It's unclear to me of what use this is for outgoing content. Clearly
one could allocate an ASN1_OCTET_STRING big enough for constructing content,
or point it at a buffer already in use.  Clearly that's nonsense if
CMS_PARTIAL is not used, and I wonder if CMS_get0_content() should return
NULL if the signature is already done.
