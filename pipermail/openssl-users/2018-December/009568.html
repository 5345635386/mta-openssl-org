<PRE>When we're starting to stoop to this level, I think it's time to step
away from the screen and take a few deep breaths...  or maybe even go
away and take a nap, go for a walk, or something else.  Then, perhaps
come back in a better mood.

Cheers,
Richard ( am off to sleep, it's getting late over here )

</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; stray cat might be tinkering in. Trimming off fat usually means
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; restructuring the structures, and unless they're opaque, the freedom
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; to do so is severily limited.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  You're implying that people can't do that anymore. Let me assure you
</I>&gt;<i>  that they still can, you just made it a little harder for people who're
</I>&gt;<i>  really determined to walk outside of the API bounds.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  On the other hand you've made the normal applications programmers job -
</I>&gt;<i>  which is to know where and when to allocate and free memory - a lot
</I>&gt;<i>  harder. Here I am, having a bunch of objects all sitting in a designated
</I>&gt;<i>  memory area of mine - which I can initialise, reset, and reuse just how
</I>&gt;<i>  I seem fit (not that I want to horribly break SSL objects, I just want
</I>&gt;<i>  to determine where they are stored) - and I can't use them because the
</I>&gt;<i>  OpenSSL devs are working on taking a little bit of power from me that I
</I>&gt;<i>  need in order to help the library do smart things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Like, imagine that I know I'll need:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - a context object
</I>&gt;<i>  - a connection object
</I>&gt;<i>  - a BIO object
</I>&gt;<i>  - some X.509 cert object/memory/whatever
</I>&gt;<i>  - and so forth and so on
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  And that not just once, but for a thousand connections. As an
</I>&gt;<i>  application programmer who knows a thing or two about scalable
</I>&gt;<i>  programming I'd be like: OK, that's fantastic. I can mmap the necessary
</I>&gt;<i>  memory, use hugepages, reduce the TLB, and just have all that stuff
</I>&gt;<i>  written on the same chunk without metadata or padding inbetween, which
</I>&gt;<i>  doesn't bloat our D$. Sweet money!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  And now I can't do that because the devs want me to use their
</I>&gt;<i>  single-object-only creation functions who return already allocated
</I>&gt;<i>  memory to me. I don't get to decide anymore where my objects are
</I>&gt;<i>  written, I don't get to decide what caching objects are used (maybe I
</I>&gt;<i>  don't WANT an X.509 cert object, so I could pass NULL to the function
</I>&gt;<i>  that creates it, or maybe I already HAVE a couple hundred of those lying
</I>&gt;<i>  here, so you can have them ... no? You prefer your structures to be
</I>&gt;<i>  opaque? Oh well).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  But, you know, it could still be argued that this is safer somehow.
</I>&gt;<i>  *Somehow*. If not ... for the fact that I don't even seem to be able to
</I>&gt;<i>  KEEP the objects OpenSSL created for me quite elaborately.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; You do know that your string insert NUL bytes, right? If you have a
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; look at how they're used, you might see why those stray NUL bytes
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; aren't a good thing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Yes, I do. See below, I wrote the last part first.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  (Also, what? Please have a look again, those stray NUL bytes wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i>  have ANY effect, at least not that I see it. One memcpy(), two
</I>&gt;<i>  EVP_DigestUpdate(), and it's always a separately calculated length).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; P.S. as a side note, your message triggered profanity filters. I
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; don't really care, it's not our filters, but this is just to inform
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; you that your rant didn't quite reach everyone (those with profanity
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; filters in place)
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; /postmaster
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  It's just that this is so stupid to me. I'm no crypto master, I know
</I>&gt;<i>  that. But I constantly hear about timing attacks and side channels and
</I>&gt;<i>  all that, so I tried to avoid stepping into the pitfalls that other
</I>&gt;<i>  people would do - and then I'm being told it's SUPPOSED to be like that.
</I>&gt;<i>  Come on, please! It's almost as if the devs aren't even trying.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  On 29.12.18 17:21, J. J. Farrell wrote:&gt; So instead of correct portable
</I>&gt;<i>  code which derives obviously and
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; straightforwardly from the specification, you'd write arrays of a
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; different length from the original, the first 48 bytes of which would
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; only be correct in some compilation environments, and even in the cases
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; where those 48 bytes end up correct they have no obvious relationship to
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; the specification they are implementing (your obfuscation making the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; code much more difficult to review). How are these changes improvements?
</I>&gt;<i>  Another implication, this time that my code isn't perfectly portable
</I>&gt;<i>  code. There is *one* environment I could think of where this wouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i>  the case - that being Shift JIS environments that tinker with ASCII
</I>&gt;<i>  standard by replacing a backslash with a Japanese half-width Yen sign -
</I>&gt;<i>  however:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  1. we'll already have much, MUCH bigger problems if ASCII isn't the
</I>&gt;<i>  encoding the compiler is expecting here, so exchanging 0x5c for '\' is
</I>&gt;<i>  not going to ruin much more here. And it doesn't even matter anyway
</I>&gt;<i>  because any Shift JIS editor would display this as the half-width Yen
</I>&gt;<i>  sign *anyways*. (And that being said, since the main criticism of the
</I>&gt;<i>  Han unification of the Unicode consortium came from the Japanese, I
</I>&gt;<i>  don't care if they're going to throw another fit. They can't even
</I>&gt;<i>  prevent mojibake between mainly Japanese character encodings. At least
</I>&gt;<i>  ISO-8859-1/CP1252 has the excuse of being the most popular encoding in
</I>&gt;<i>  the entire west, so ... whatever. Just let them rail.)
</I>&gt;<i>  2. to be honest I wouldn't have have this be a static array at all, but
</I>&gt;<i>  rather an exportable pointer and an exportable variable that would hold
</I>&gt;<i>  the string's size minus one. However, if you actually HAD looked at the
</I>&gt;<i>  code as is - which you obviously haven't because you wouldn't have even
</I>&gt;<i>  brought it up then - the size of the array is completely inconsequential
</I>&gt;<i>  in that particular code. That's right: they don't even derive the
</I>&gt;<i>  amounts of bytes to copy from the string directly, but rather just use a
</I>&gt;<i>  constant:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; npad = (48 / md_size) * md_size;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Oh, you want me to change that? No problem:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; #define STRING \
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &quot;xxxxxxxx&quot; \
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &quot;xxxxxxxx&quot; \
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &quot;xxxxxxxx&quot; \
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &quot;xxxxxxxx&quot; \
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &quot;xxxxxxxx&quot; \
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &quot;xxxxxxxx&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; const unsigned char string_length = sizeof(STRING) - 1;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; const char*string = STRING;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; npad = (string_length / md_size) * md_size;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Hell, I could even create a macro for this so that I don't even need the
</I>&gt;<i>  explicit definition of STRING here. It's not as if OpenSSL shies away
</I>&gt;<i>  from the concept of using macros to auto-generate a plethora of symbols
</I>&gt;<i>  (I'm looking at include/openssl/crypto.h right now).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; I'd walk you out of an interview if you offered this as an
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; implementation, let alone as an improvement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Don't worry, I'd fire you on the spot if you had checked in the existing
</I>&gt;<i>  code, so I'll call it quits.
