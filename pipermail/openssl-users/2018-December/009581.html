</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You realised what I have left unspoken thus far, which is this almost

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improving the old, boring codebase. However, there's a reason why it's still

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the long run.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There has been a huge amount of effort put in over the last few years to improve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the codebase. Things that immediately spring to mind (and there's probably a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whole load more):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Rewrite of the state machine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - libssl record layer refactor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Implementation of the PACKET and WPACKET abstractions in libssl
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Rewrite of the rand code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Implementation of the new test harness
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Significant effort into developing tests
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Implementation of the coding style and reformat of the codebase to meet it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Opaque many of the structures (which I know you don't see as an improvement,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I'll answer that point separately)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Implementation of continuous fuzzing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Significant expansion of the documentation coverage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is simply not true to claim that we have &quot;an obsession-like preference...to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> add new features rather than improving the old, boring codebase&quot;. None of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> above things resulted in or were motivated by user visible features. They were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all about improving the codebase.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, infrastructure again. I, as a user, don't care if the kernel gets a new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feature that makes some black magic happening. What I care about is that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kernel doesn't throw away my writes (which has happened in May of 2018, see):

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cryptography libs should be equally conservative, considering that cryptography
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is conservative to begin with. I don't care if TLS 1.3 lets me use new exiting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ciphers and handshakes when it unreasonably bogs down my server code.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BUT, you also have to appreciate that stuff is happening around us
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that affects our focus. TLS 1.3 happened, and rather than having to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answer the question &quot;why don't you have TLS 1.3 yet?&quot; (there's a LOT
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of interest in that version), we decided to add it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sure, but didn't Matt just say that there are a lot of volunteers working on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that library? The disadvantage here is that quality assurance is barely a thing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - however, the *advantage* of this is that OpenSSL does not have to follow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commercial interests. If we look at this at face value you could just say &quot;No,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people, it's high time we streamline some of the internal aspects of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> library, TLS 1.3 will have to wait. You can't wait that long? Well, sorry&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, your message is clear, we do need to do some cleanup as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well. More than that, I agree with you that it's needed (I've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> screamed out in angst when stumbling upon particularly ugly or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> misplaced code, so the feeling is shared, more than you might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> believe).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But what does &quot;cleanup&quot; entail? That's the hot-button question here. I've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already made a suggestion, that is to say, getting rid of opaque structures. If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is deemed too insecure (for whatever reasons), export symbols that allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> programmers to query the size of structures, and provide two versions of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functions: one function expects the caller to pass an object to which the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes are to be made, and the other one allocates the necessary memory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dynamically and then calls the first version. Or just don't allocate my object
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory dynamically anymore.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That being said, cleanup happens, and documentation happens, in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> piecemeal fashion, 'cause that's what most people have capacity for.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, what you're effectively saying is that I'm the first one who ever asked for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SSL object reuse, right? Because if piecemeal work happens on the documentation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and Viktor says that it's possible, then surely no one would have ever answered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that question on the mailing list and *not* put it piecemeal-ly in the OpenSSL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documentation, right?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, here's something else that you need to consider: API/ABI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compatibility needs to be preserved.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No it doesn't. We *know* it doesn't. When OpenSSL 1.1 was released it broke all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *sorts* of applications out there, because all sorts of applications used struct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fields rather than accessors. wget, mutt, neon, python, you name it, you broke it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> API/ABI stability is absolutely required. Every time we make a breaking change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is painful for our users - and more pain is felt the bigger the scale of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> break. We simply cannot go around making wholesale breaks on an ongoing basis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we did so then OpenSSL would be a lot less useful to our users.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is not to say that we can *never* make breaking changes. Only that when we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do so it must be strongly justified and only done relatively infrequently. We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> made such a decision when we decided to make the structures opaque. It's not a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision we are likely to repeat anytime soon IMO. We are still feeling the pain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of that now (and will continue to do so for at least the next year until 1.0.2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> goes out of support - and probably beyond that).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Which brings me onto why structures were made opaque in the first place. A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> significant driver for this (probably *the* most important one) was to improve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the codebase. I have witnessed first hand the harm that non-opaque structures
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> did to OpenSSL. We will be fixing the fallout from them for years to come.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Non-opaque structures combined with the requirements for stable API/ABI means
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you cannot change anything in those structures. Renaming or deleting structure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> members constitutes an API break. Even *adding* structure members constitutes an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ABI break (due to the changed size of the structure). This means the code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ossifies over time and cannot easily be refactored. Much of OpenSSL's internal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;quirkiness&quot; results from attempting to work around this restriction.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Things like the state machine refactor and the record layer refactor would not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have been possible without opaque structures. In my mind making the structures
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opaque was one of the best things that ever happened to OpenSSL.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://breakpoint.cc/openssl-1.1-rebuild-2016-08-26/">https://breakpoint.cc/openssl-1.1-rebuild-2016-08-26/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So since when do we need to consider API/ABI compatibility? Did we grow up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recently?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or maybe OpenSSL should have switched the language. The point of C is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> structures are public. And if I'm going to be honest that approach saved my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sorry arse more than a couple times. When zlib choked because it couldn't go
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> past 4 GiBs of data since its fields were uint32_ts, I was able to easily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> workaround this problem. But what do I know.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you really want to fiddle with OpenSSL internal structures - feel free. Just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> include the OpenSSL internal header files and away you go. Just do so in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> knowledge that they could be changed at any time, and your code might break. If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this isn't a concern to you then - no problem. If it is a concern to you - then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually you *do* care about API/ABI stability after all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Counting symbols is, however, nothing other than a blunt instrument.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Quite a lot of those symbols are convenience macros and functions that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have accumulated over time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You're taking my statement out of context. Counting the symbols wasn't supposed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to suggest that there are too *many* of them. I'm in no position to say that,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seeing as the original context in which my statement was put is that *I'm not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> familiar enough with the library*.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What I said was that reading the code is easy. Learning what the library
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provides is hard, and that you won't learn much just by looking at the symbols
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because there's so many of them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But nevertheless, I do hear you call for a remake of the SSL API as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well as cleaner internals. The latter is easier, and I'm sure it will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happen piecemeal as per usual so as to not break something /
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inadvertently change a behavior (i.e. break ABI). The former is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fairly massive project, and is more of creating a new API and library
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather than a mere cleanup job. That will be a massive effort, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you do have to keep in mind how much time all involved can put into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not saying it needs to be done right now. I'm merely suggesting that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might be a good goal post for OpenSSL 2.0.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Turning structures opaque doesn't prevent people from still messing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with their internal fields.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> True. But it makes for a clear delineation where people are forced to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be aware that they are playing with internal stuff, and that it may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not be a safe thing to do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then why not provide small helper functions for covering the &quot;playing with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> internal stuff&quot; part? That way it's still controlled, and documented, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unified. You guys must've had some examples to show off in order to justify the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process, so surely you know what it is that people do when they use internal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stuff. Make functions for those. Don't give them any reason to continue playing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with internal stuff.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't like code that tries to protect programmers from themselves. I like code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that lets good programmers do smart things. And if bad programmers use that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> freedom to do bad stuff, then doesn't that mean your API simply didn't support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this, and they had to make it work somehow else? Again, helper functions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Uhmmmm.... this is factually incorrect. OpenSSL doesn't use its own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory pooling. We have thin wrappers around the usual malloc() /
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> realloc() / free(), which allows any application to do its own memory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pooling.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The BUF_FREELISTS code that this post references was ripped out years ago. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no longer represents the current state of OpenSSL in any supported version.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To conclude, I have a question for you: are you only willing to rant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (*), or are you willing to help out in another way?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is not the question I feel you should ask because we haven't even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> established if I *could* make contributions to the project, as my mindset
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appears to be so much more different. Especially the idea of not wanting to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> break APIs/ABIs is a huge limitation - just looking at SSL_new() made me give up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hope here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes - not breaking APIs/ABIs is a huge limitation. BoringSSL is not suitable for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general purpose use precisely because of this. The only users BoringSSL cares
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about whether they break or not are Google users. As soon as you have a library
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that wants to cater for large numbers of users (which we do) then you have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accept that limitation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As to whether or not we have established whether you *could* make such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contributions - I think you are missing the point. We cannot know whether you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are capable or not until you try. It is on the basis of your code that we would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make such a judgement. In order for your code to get into OpenSSL it must have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been reviewed and approved by two current OpenSSL committers (one of whom must
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be on the OpenSSL Management Committee). We invite anyone to contribute. In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> order for this to be a healthy open-source community we *need* those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contributions. Only those that make the grade will make it in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Note - this review process wasn't always the case. Things used to be much more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> informal in pre-heartbleed days. This is no longer the case.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm no cryptography expert, I've made that clear from mail one, and my cleanup
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> jobs would be more widespread than what seems to be deemed acceptable right now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can read and write scalable C code, otherwise I wouldn't even have tried to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reuse that SSL object from the beginning.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, I ask a question in return: what do you think I *could* be helping with?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, you have vocally complained about the state of the documentation. You have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the benefit of being a new OpenSSL user. You know what things were confusing or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unclear in the documentation. More experienced OpenSSL coders often don't have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the perspective - because some things are just &quot;obvious&quot; to them. So help with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pull requests to improve the documentation.
