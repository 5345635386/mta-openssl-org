</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My question is thusly how to implement authentication over ECDHE in the best

How about using PSKs? That way you completely avoid the need for a certificate.
Authentication is implied since both peers must have access to the PSK for the
connection to succeed. ECDHE can be combined with the PSK to create a temporary
key for the connection, thus giving you forward secrecy, e.g. using a
ciphersuite such as ECDHE-PSK-AES128-CBC-SHA256.
