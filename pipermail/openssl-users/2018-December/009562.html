You don't explain the benefits of coding a requirement for &quot;the byte 
0x5C repeated 48 times&quot; as a string of back-slash characters instead of, 
well, the byte 0x5C repeated 48 times. What are the benefits, and how do 
they outweigh the ability to compare more easily against the requirement?

You don't explain the benefits of writing non-portable code where that 
code is very widely deployed in environments of which you have no 
knowledge (and which don't even exist at the time of writing it), 
without even a comment specifying the portability restrictions you are 
imposing, when it's just as easy to write the code portably and not need 
to think about such restrictions. What are the benefits, and how do they 
outweigh the obvious disadvantages?
