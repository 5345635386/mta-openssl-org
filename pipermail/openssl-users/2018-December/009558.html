</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not entirely sure, but I *think* it's 1.1.0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =====================================================================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so I've been reading the mails before going to sleep and spent 
</I>&gt;<i> some time thinking and researching about this, and I've come to a 
</I>&gt;<i> conclusion: OpenSSL is a goddamn mess, SSL_clear() is pretty much 
</I>&gt;<i> superfluous, and as such shouldn't exist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why? Well, to quote Viktor here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DO NOT reuse the same SSL handle for multiple connections,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And that is fricking bullshit. Not the quote itself or the suggestion 
</I>&gt;<i> - it's unlikely you had anything to do with the actual code - but the 
</I>&gt;<i> way things have been thought through (or rather, have not been thought 
</I>&gt;<i> through) by the library devs. I've written highly scalable libraries 
</I>&gt;<i> in the past before, and one thing you always want to do there is to 
</I>&gt;<i> trim fat. And &quot;object allocation and initialisation&quot; is something that 
</I>&gt;<i> you very much want to trim fat of, not only for obvious reasons such 
</I>&gt;<i> as malloc() and free() (or whatever OpenSSL uses as wrappers) being 
</I>&gt;<i> complexity monsters, but also for cache reasons (loading different 
</I>&gt;<i> cache line hurts performance). That's why you usually have functions 
</I>&gt;<i> like XXX_clear() or XXX_reset(), which do exactly that - prepare an 
</I>&gt;<i> object for another usage. memset() (or the OpenSSL equivalent of a 
</I>&gt;<i> secure memset) your allocated resources. I don't really see the 
</I>&gt;<i> problem here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now add to that the fact that OpenSSL has been moving towards making 
</I>&gt;<i> its structures opaque, thus falling into the same trap that Microsoft 
</I>&gt;<i> has with COM and DirectX, and you can kind of see why, if you can't 
</I>&gt;<i> really determine anymore WHERE your object is going to be stored, you 
</I>&gt;<i> at least want to keep reusing it. This is not PHP, where people 
</I>&gt;<i> allocate memory all willy-nilly, or C++, where people don't even have 
</I>&gt;<i> shame anymore to use std::vector&lt;std::strings&gt; str_array instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> good old static const char*const str_array[] while expecting things to 
</I>&gt;<i> be made faster by invisible memory pools (and horribly failing at it), 
</I>&gt;<i> but C, where you want to think about each step quite carefully.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then OpenSSL even provides an SSL_clear function which is advertised 
</I>&gt;<i> like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SSL_clear - reset SSL object to allow another connection
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> , and then, only later, in a big warning block, decides to tell the 
</I>&gt;<i> reader that this function only works when the stars align quite 
</I>&gt;<i> correctly and you've sacrificed at least two virgins, because:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The reset operation however keeps several settings of the last
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sessions
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then, as the documentation suggests, I read the entry for 
</I>&gt;<i> SSL_get_session:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The ssl session contains all information required to re-establish the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connection without a full handshake for SSL versions up to and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; including TLSv1.2. In TLSv1.3 the same is true, but sessions are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; established after the main handshake has occurred.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And at this point it all falls apart. From my understanding OpenSSL 
</I>&gt;<i> keeps a session cache for servers so that key exchanges and protocol 
</I>&gt;<i> handshakes can be avoided. Problem is, *we're using ECDHE, where the 
</I>&gt;<i> last E stands for &quot;ephemeral&quot;*. In simple English: throw away the keys 
</I>&gt;<i> after you're done, we want to have forward secrecy. And then OpenSSL 
</I>&gt;<i> keeps a fresh copy of those for everyone who happened to be logged on 
</I>&gt;<i> at this point. Heartbleed apparently wasn't enough of a warning. Oh, 
</I>&gt;<i> but lets move everything to the heap so that it's more secure there now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to reuse a session with ephemeral keys; I want to reuse 
</I>&gt;<i> an object that is supposed to already have resources allocated for 
</I>&gt;<i> doing its job, as is indicated by the documentation of this function 
</I>&gt;<i> except for a small note at the end that tells you that the devs didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> really think about what &quot;ephemeral&quot; means.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The session caching in the SSL and TLS protocols is to skip the
expensive key exchange when reconnecting within a few seconds,
as is extremely common with web browsers opening up to 8 parallel
connections to each server.

There is hopefully a configuration option to tell the OpenSSL server
end SSL_CTX to not do this, just as there should (for multi-process
web servers) be an option to hand the state storage over to the web
server application for inter-process sharing in whatever the web
server application (and its configuration) deems secure.

&gt;<i> Creating a new SSL object (EVEN FROM AN EXISTING SSL_CTX object) entails:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - allocating the memory for the object itself on the heap (via 
</I>&gt;<i> OPENSSL_zalloc)
</I>&gt;<i> - creating and managing a new lock for the object, and who knows for 
</I>&gt;<i> much more subobjects
</I>&gt;<i> - creating a duplicate of the cipher suite stack (which isn't even a 
</I>&gt;<i> flat copy, but something that can cause the code to call 
</I>&gt;<i> OPENSSL_malloc *twice* in the worst case)
</I>&gt;<i> - creating a duplicate of the certificates (which I don't even use, 
</I>&gt;<i> but that doesn't stop the code of ssl_cert_dup() to call 
</I>&gt;<i> OPENSSL_zalloc *in its very first line!*)
</I>&gt;<i> - setting up a bunch of callbacks
</I>&gt;<i> - copying 32 bytes for a sid_ctx
</I>&gt;<i> - creating an X509_VERIFY_PARAM object (*which calls OPENSSL_zalloc 
</I>&gt;<i> again*) as well as creating a deep copy of the SSL_CTX's parameter via 
</I>&gt;<i> X509_VERIFY_PARAM_inherit(), with Thor knows how many copies hidden in 
</I>&gt;<i> all those *set* and *deep_copy* routines
</I>&gt;<i> - copying EC point formats from the context - deep again, of course, 
</I>&gt;<i> at least that's what OPENSSL_memdup() makes me think
</I>&gt;<i> - copying supported group informations, and of course deep again!
</I>&gt;<i> - deep-copying an ALPN object
</I>&gt;<i> - SSL_clear()-ing the object (no, really!)
</I>&gt;<i> - deep-copying a CRYPTO_EX_DATA object via CRYPTO_new_ex_data ... at 
</I>&gt;<i> this point, is anyone surprised here that timing attacks against 
</I>&gt;<i> crypto are *still* so successful? Because I'm not. Not at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't bother looking up what freeing entails - it's obvious to 
</I>&gt;<i> anyone at this point that OpenSSL is a severe victim of feature creep, 
</I>&gt;<i> that its memory allocation scheme is a mess, and long story short: I 
</I>&gt;<i> will NOT free a perfectly fine object just because of incompetent 
</I>&gt;<i> devs' chutzpah expecting their users to allocate memory dynamically en 
</I>&gt;<i> mass for no goddamn reason whenever a new connection comes in. Fix 
</I>&gt;<i> your goddamn code.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Well, these two latter arrays look like a stray copy of the HMAC
constants &quot;ipad&quot; and &quot;opad&quot;, which (while looking like ASCII), are
defined as exact hex constants even on a non-ASCII machine, such
as PDP-11 or an IBM mainframe.

I wonder if those constants are actually still used somewhere in
the SSL3 code, or if they have been properly replaced by calls to
the HMAC implementation in libcrypto.

Enjoy
