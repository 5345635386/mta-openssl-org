Dear Team
 
 
 
We have installed httpd-2.2.25-win32-x86-openssl-0.9.8y apache web server which has openssl .9.8y as a part of the package, we ran the vulnerability scan for the same
 
 
 
The system admin team has suggested to upgrade openssl 0.9.8zb, how do we go about it?
 
 
 
We have used openssl to generate the server key and csr for ssl certificate installation and the ssl certificate certificate has been successfully installed.
 
 
 
After upgrading to the openssl 0.9.8zb, should we regenerate the server key and csr and reinstall the ssl certificate..
 
 
 
What is the advantage of using openssl 0.9.8zb over openssl-0.9.8y
 
 
 
Regards
 
Rajesh
