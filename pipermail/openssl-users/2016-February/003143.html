Well which version of OpenSSL is being used by the server and what software is
the client using?

When client auth is enabled the client presents its certificate chain to the
server. It also signs some data using the private key corresponsing to the
public key in the client certificate and the server verifies that signature.

It looks like it is this latter signature which is causing the problems and
nothing to do with the certificates (though they have some odd fields in there
OpenSSL wouldn't reject them). As I mentioned the type of signature a client
generates during client auth changed in TLS 1.2. It is possible that the
client is sending an invalid signature which the server is rejecting while
the different form used for TLS 1.1 and earlier is fine.
