</I>&gt;<i> I'm working with PosgreSQL in a DoD environment and am supposed to enforce FIPS operation. PostgreSQL doesn't perform a call to FIP_mode_set() but does provide a configuration item 'ssl_ciphers'. Is there more to FIPS_mode than I am aware of or would it be functionally equivalent to simply set my ciphers to something like 'FIPS:!aNULL:!eNULL&#8217;?
</I>
Yes, there is more to it.  From a technical standpoint, several &#8220;power-on self-tests&#8221; are supposed to be run in order for FIPS mode to be enabled.  While my own experience is the DoD&#8217;s auditors are a lot looser with the rules than most, other people report the opposite, and even the looser ones I&#8217;ve been in contact with would never allow what you&#8217;re suggesting.  You really need to be modifying PostgreSQL to invoke FIPS_mode_set(), and understand that there may be more to it than that.  I haven&#8217;t looked in a long time, but there are conceivably runtime issues if you just add that single call.

Also, depending on the auditor, you&#8217;d probably need to modify PostgreSQL&#8217;s documentation, too, so that it cannot in any way refer to non-approved algorithms as cryptography (except as allowed by relevant NIST publications, but I think SHA-1 is the only special case).  That could be tricky, and it&#8217;s up to the you to prove it&#8217;s OK, and then to remove the references anyway if the auditor still doesn&#8217;t like it. :)

&gt;<i> As a semi-related question, would a non-FIPS OpenSSL installation still enforce the same cipher suites but just not be 'officially' validated?
</I>
AFAIK, you could limit it to the appropriate cipher suites, but be aware that FIPS 140 is all about proving that only certain known and tested [implementations of] algorithms are used.  It&#8217;s unlikely that another version of OpenSSL would use exactly the same implementations (after all, fixes and performance enhancements have been added), and there&#8217;d still be nothing to prove those are the approved algorithms, even if they were the exact same.  So I can&#8217;t imagine any auditor approving such a setup.

OpenSSL doesn&#8217;t provide a cheap, easy answer to the issues surrounding FIPS 140 compliance, but it does significantly reduce the cost of effort for those producing software.  For those who rely on third-party software, it still helps, but it&#8217;s usually going to be a lot more effort than just &#8220;add the OpenSSL FIPS module&#8221; to the system. :)
