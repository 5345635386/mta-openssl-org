<PRE>Hello,

I'm hoping you could provide some assistance in diagnosing/investigating an
issue my users are experiencing with FireFox.  Our CDN is using
OpenSSL  1.0.1j-1.4.0.420.  In addition to the below, I did try contacting
Dr. Henson on this topic (his name was referenced in some of the old online
posts) but suspect he has other pressing matters to deal with.  I've
included the body of the message to him here:

--
I'd be thankful for you guidance in an issue I'm investigating.  The error
in the subject has been encountered at random by some of my users when
using Firefox.  In researching this issue I've come across a number of
dated articles/bits of information that suggest at one point there was a
bug in OpenSSL 0.9.8g that caused this error.

Since this is a client side error, I understand this may no longer be tied
to the original OpenSSL bug, however I was hoping to rule it out.  In doing
so I wanted to trace the changelist referenced in the firefox bug post @
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=430703">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=430703</A> however it looks as
though the tranition to GitHub has since made the link obsolete.  The link
in question is <A HREF="http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17098">http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17098</A> and there is
reference to your involvement in this issue.

I've checked the release notes @
<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/news/changelog.html#x35">https://www.openssl.org/news/changelog.html#x35</A> between g to h and h to i
to see if I could get any details that way, but admittedly much of the ssl
jargon is greek to me.

Is there anything you could offer that would help me trace the change that
was implemented in 17098 ?

Hi Shaun,

As the documentation suggests, this is very likely a server problem. We
have recently audited the NSS state machine and I think it would be
unlikely that this is a client issue.

I would definitely look at the servers. Old versions of openssl are full of
holes anyway.

If you are able to capture logs for an affected connection and share those
we might be able to help you diagnose the issue. Or maybe you can point us
at a public endpoint that reliably produces the error.
