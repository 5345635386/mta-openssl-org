<PRE>Someone picked up an old dead thread, but I'll make some brief
responses.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Disable them by default.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I suggest following the 80/20 rule (sometimes the 95/5 rule):
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Those &#8220;who care&#8221; (the minority) about the ciphers can re-enable them

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Those &#8220;who don&#8217;t care&#8221; (the majority) about the ciphers, should get 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the functionality
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that most people care about, basically SSL/TLS connectivity.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You all seem to misunderstand the fundamental release engineering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issues involved.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Very shortly after you release OpenSSL 1.1.0, many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    distributions and pointy haired managers will blindly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    switch to the new version as the only version available.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     This will not at all await the &quot;end of support&quot; for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    OpenSSL 1.0.x .  So breaking changes will cause harm much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    sooner than you claim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As one of those pointy haired managers, I have to say that
</I>&gt;<i> this scenario is simply not possible with the ABI incompatibility
</I>&gt;<i> between OpenSSL 1.0.2 and OpenSSL 1.1.0 - applications will
</I>&gt;<i> have to be updated, too. (unless I'm completely misunderstanding
</I>&gt;<i> something). So, most likely we're looking at a universe where
</I>&gt;<i> both will coexist for awhile (that seems to match up with
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL's support plans as well).
</I>This shows you are not pointy-haired enough to fit this
example.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Think of this like when OpenSSL went from 0.9.8 to 1.0.0.
</I>&gt;<i> Both co-existed for quite awhile.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>However the differences between 0.9.8 and 1.0.0 were
much smaller than the upcoming differences between
1.0.x and 1.1.x .

They are basically removing lots of functionality
for very little gain.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Because of the need to easily keep up with routine security
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    updates to OpenSSL, it is highly impractical to maintain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    locally reconfigured build scripts and patches, though some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    of us have no choice (and are still struggling with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    massively huge and disorganized code reformatting in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    middle of the 1.0.1 security update series).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not envy this work, but we're talking about a security
</I>&gt;<i> toolkit - it should not stay in the past. It's, quite simply,
</I>&gt;<i> dangerous to do so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>But it should not do things that leave past &quot;customers&quot;
unprotected because they can no longer use the current
but incompatible toolkit.  Because that in and of itself
is also very dangerous.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. When distributions upgrade OpenSSL, many applications that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    have not been actively and deliberately ported to the new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    OpenSSL version will be blindly recompiled with the new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    versions, and if they break, random developers with no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    understanding of either the application, OpenSSL or even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    security will do ill-informed rushed patches to try to undo
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    the breakage you caused.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sadly, that happens when any toolkit updates.
</I>Yes, but some updates are more likely to cause such
harm than others.  Thisis the whole reason the entire
computer industryis so keen on backwards compatibility.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. OpenSSL is THE primary crypto library for the FOSS universe.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    You may be volunteers, but you are working on a massively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    important piece of software, not some random optional library.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but they are still allowed to change for the better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> GnuTLS did this as well, between their 2.x release and 3.x.
</I>&gt;<i> There is precendence. It is not pain free, but it is what
</I>&gt;<i> we all need to do to make a better and safter internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bad choices made now will haunt us for another 10+ years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I was arguing that they *are* making bad choices now.

Enjoy
