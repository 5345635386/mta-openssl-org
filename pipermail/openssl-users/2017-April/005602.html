Your trace shows the following interactions occurring:

Client                         Server
------                         ------

ClientHello          --------&gt;
                     &lt;-------- ServerHello
                     &lt;-------- Certificate
                     &lt;-------- CertificateRequest
                     &lt;-------- ServerDone
Certificate          ---------&gt;
ClientKeyExchange    ---------&gt;
CertificateVerify    ---------&gt;
CCS                  ---------&gt;
[Encrypted Finished]

We would expect the server to continue with its own CCS and Encrypted
Finished to complete the handshake. It seems that, for some reason, the
server is not receiving (or acting upon) the client's second flight of
messages.

Normally in DTLS this sort of thing can happen due to lost messages etc
but, obviously, with SCTP, this is not the case. Something else must be
happening.

In your description you say SSL_accept() gets called repeatedly and
always gives SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ. Looking at your code it looks like you
are calling pollSocketForEvents() after each accept. I am assuming that
this is returning true each time (otherwise you would break out of the
loop). This suggests that the &quot;select&quot; call thinks there is something to
read from the underlying socket. Am I correct? The question is why
doesn't OpenSSL then read that data out of the socket?

Are you able to build a debug version of OpenSSL (run &quot;config&quot; with -d),
and step through to figure out where it gets stuck. Is it attempting to
read the data and failing, or does it not get as far attempting to read it?

Another question: does this fail every time or does it sometimes work
and sometimes not (which might suggest some race condition)?
