</I>&gt;<i> If I get a moment I'll try and get it back up to date.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, for the shutdown case, it would be nice (in general) if attempting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shutdown during a handshake will make the handshake abort as soon as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protocol allows, rather than going through all the remaining steps and their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transmissions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In other words, returning appropriate errors/alerts to the other end

</I>&gt;<i> The problem here is that you have a suspended fibre midway through the
</I>&gt;<i> handshake operation. It may have allocated memory not just on the stack
</I>&gt;<i> local to the fibre but dynamically on the heap. The fibre must be resumed
</I>&gt;<i> to allow it to return up the stack and exit the fibre. When you are
</I>&gt;<i> running asynchronously you are also by definition going to be running
</I>&gt;<i> with non-blocking sockets. This means when you recall the
</I>&gt;<i> SSL_do_handshake to resume the fibre you are only going to keep
</I>&gt;<i> recalling it until the point it first comes back up the stack and exits the
</I>&gt;<i> fibre. This will happen at the first point you try and do some non blocking
</I>&gt;<i> I/O, i.e. send or receive during the handshake. At that point you will be
</I>&gt;<i> in the same situation you are in if you were running synchronously with
</I>&gt;<i> non blocking sockets (you may have detected the error earlier when
</I>&gt;<i> running asynchronously but both asynchronous and synchronous
</I>&gt;<i> only act on it at the same stage of the handshake).
</I>&gt;<i> The pain point for the user is in having to remember the error has
</I>&gt;<i> occurred and keep recalling the SSL_do_handshake until the
</I>&gt;<i> async job (fibre) has completed.
</I>Let me clarify: The idea was not to change the synchronization structure,
but to set a flag or otherwise (asynchronously or in a small critical
section) change the state such that when the communication async
operations resume, they will proceed directly to a failure state
skipping as much of the processing and transmission as possible.

For example if it was waiting for a &quot;hello&quot; from the other end,
when that &quot;hello&quot; arrives, it would not process the bytes in that
hello, but respond as if it received a bad hello (with
&quot;aborted/closed&quot; rather than &quot;invalid hello&quot; as the error/alert
code).  It would not proceed to e.g. validate incoming public keys,
send public keys, generate nonces, derive keys etc.

This serves two purposes: To make the &quot;SSL_shutdown&quot; call &quot;just work&quot;
from an application perspective, and to minimize security exposure
after the call has been made (e.g. in case some application level
code decides the other end is probably malicious).

Enjoy
