Yes, I raised a pull request for something similar here:
<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/1736">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/1736</A>
Unfortunately it is over 6 months old now and needs to be rebased and brought 
up to date with the latest master (my bad as I've not had time).
If I get a moment I'll try and get it back up to date.

The problem here is that you have a suspended fibre midway through the
handshake operation. It may have allocated memory not just on the stack
local to the fibre but dynamically on the heap. The fibre must be resumed
to allow it to return up the stack and exit the fibre. When you are 
running asynchronously you are also by definition going to be running
with non-blocking sockets. This means when you recall the
SSL_do_handshake to resume the fibre you are only going to keep 
recalling it until the point it first comes back up the stack and exits the 
fibre. This will happen at the first point you try and do some non blocking 
I/O, i.e. send or receive during the handshake. At that point you will be
in the same situation you are in if you were running synchronously with
non blocking sockets (you may have detected the error earlier when 
running asynchronously but both asynchronous and synchronous
only act on it at the same stage of the handshake).
The pain point for the user is in having to remember the error has 
occurred and keep recalling the SSL_do_handshake until the
async job (fibre) has completed.
