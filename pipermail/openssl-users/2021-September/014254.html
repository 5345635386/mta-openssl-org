</I>&gt;<i>Well.  The thing is, to me, that commits happen much more often than tags.  Tags are in a different namespace also.  &quot;Sealing the
</I>&gt;<i>branches&quot; with a signed commit at times helps in case of trouble, even for a distributed version control system like git, with its &quot;hardened

</I>&gt;<i>offer only https?, and &quot;seal&quot; all stable/ and release/ branches as well as master, only the development branches have no signature.)
</I>
The git signature structure is based on GPG signatures for one, not SHA-1. The tag namespace does not matter here. The signature becomes invalid if the combined tree of the commit the tag references changes. If the commit is replaced, the signature becomes invalid regardless of who does it. You can replace a signed commit with another signed commit but you would need to have the public side of the GPG key to validate it. A tag would not point to the new commit without breaking the signature. No one could replace Richard's signature, for example, except for Richard on the openssl-3.0.0 tag. The &quot;breaking the infrastructure&quot; would have to reconstruct the Merkel Tree, which, even in SHA-1 has a one in a billion chance of working, but that is unlikely to result in useful source code.

So there is a certain amount of trust of the signatures of the committers - they should probably publish their public keys so we can do the validation. It might be helpful if GitHub moved to SHA-256 repositories, though.
