You are right in everything that you say.

 |Strictly speaking, the signature on a tag is considered immutable and \

 |but the effect is the same). The signature on a tag becomes invalid \

The tag namespace is separate though.  Not that it matters in
practice.  Just saying.

 |-style authority (not quite - I used &quot;-style&quot;), providing that you \
 |do trust the signers. I think the word for that is &quot;over-kill&quot; &#128521;, \
 |but maybe not in the case of OpenSSL.

Well.  The thing is, to me, that commits happen much more often
than tags.  Tags are in a different namespace also.  &quot;Sealing the
branches&quot; with a signed commit at times helps in case of trouble,
even for a distributed version control system like git, with its
&quot;hardened SHA-1&quot; checksums.  So of course all the core developers
and a lot of other people have full repo clones and shall someone
break in some infrastructure and mess around the OpenSSL team
could simply talk and exchange hashes, and reinstantiate the
master proper.  For people having local clones that came in via
<A HREF="git://">git://</A> protocol even a signed commit here and there would really
be nice.  (For my tiny things i offer only https?, and &quot;seal&quot; all
stable/ and release/ branches as well as master, only the
development branches have no signature.)
