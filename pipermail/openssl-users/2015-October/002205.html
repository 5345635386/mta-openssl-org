</I>&gt;<i> Who was calling who at what time.
</I>
this is not a problem as long as the public keys (the certificates) are
not really public;
because in your example Eve doesn't have the knowledge which certificate
the specific serial number has ...

if the public keys (the certificates) are searchable by public - the worst
case direct by a search engine like google - then you would get an
absolute security whole:
think of some bad boys, they could get such certificates and get two
things with these: a valid e-mail address and everything they need to send
encrypted data to this e-mail address, and with this: they can send
anything: malware, spyware, whatever; no antivirus, spamfilter, or
whatever on any mailserver would stop such emails; everything hangs on the
client ...

the scenario you gave above is the less problem ...

&gt;&gt;<i> there is one thing that is problematic - especially if the CA is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somewhat stupid:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using one responder certificate for all OCSP responses for any end
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entity certificate ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (the specific RFC says, that it is discouraged to do so)
</I>&gt;<i> This is not about the OCSP-response signing certificate
</I>&gt;<i> (or the CRL signing certificate).
</I>No it is about them ...
<A HREF="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc6960.txt.pdf">https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc6960.txt.pdf</A> (stupid CAs
- I know at least one - ignore the section on top of page 17)
with such CAs it is easy to pretend something different ...

&gt;&gt;<i> faking the OCSP response by 3rd party to pretend a good certificate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even it is bad,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is quite a little bit difficult, but easy if the CA is stupid ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However with careful choice/generation of certificates
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for the OCSP/CRL server, this can be easily avoided.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easily - are you sure?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (a) you want to check cert 1 that was signed by the CAs cert A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (b) the server uses certificate 2 that was signed by the CAs cert B
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with https this would be the following:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to access the CRL or OCSP of cert 1, you need to validate cert 2,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that itself is needed to access the CRL or OCSP of cert 2, too?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said it involves recursion and the trick is to
</I>&gt;<i> terminate that recursion before it gets infinitely
</I>&gt;<i> deep.
</I>
it is more a deadlock than a recursion ...

&gt;<i> Another obvious way would be for that final https
</I>&gt;<i> server to do OCSP-stapling,
</I>
this would be a solution but as soon as using SSL/TLS layer communication
for CRL download or OCSP, for whatever reason, accepting OCSP-stapling is
strongly discouraged, this is nearly like self-signed ...

I'd say security is more important privacy;

Greetings,
Walter
