There is a potential issue to consider if you were going to do it this
way. All modern clients will send 0x16 as the first byte of their
ClientHello. However this was not always the case, and you may encounter
some legacy clients that do not do this (for example OpenSSL 0.9.8
doesn't). Historically it was common to send SSLv2 backward compatible
ClientHellos - even if what is eventually negotiated is SSLv3 or above.
OpenSSL 0.9.8 will happily negotiate TLS1.0 by sending a SSLv2 backward
compatible ClientHello. Note this doesn't have anything to do with the
support for SSLv2 itself. Even servers which have disabled SSLv2 (which
is considered good practice), will usually accept this ClientHello
format (OpenSSL 1.0.2 does).

The first two bytes of the backward compatible format are the message
length. The most significant bit of the first byte is always set, so
this means you could conceivably receive anything from 0x80 or above, as
well as 0x16 as your first byte.

You may wish to look at how OpenSSL does protocol version detection to
help you. See the function ssl23_get_client_hello() in ssl/s23_srvr.c of
the OpenSSL 1.0.2 source code.
