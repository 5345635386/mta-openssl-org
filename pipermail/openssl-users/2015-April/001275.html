Hello,
I recently implemented a secured communication between two sites in which one acts as the server and the other as the client. To accomplish this, I used openssl to generate self-signed CA, Server and Client certificates (the calls are made using cURL).
It all works beautifully and, testing my &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; has shown that if one of the pieces is missing from the equation (CA, Server, Client certificates), the communication ceases.
But once I showed my work to people in my company, one of them asked me why did I choose not to add the client hostname to the Client Certificate, thus making it usable only by that specific client.
And so I started searching online for ways to do it, but found nothing. I also looked into the openssl site and documentation and found nothing there either. The truth is that I don't even know if this is possible or even if this is the right question to ask.&#160;
But can it be done? And if so, could you show me how, or where should I go to get more information on how to accomplish this?
If you need more information on how I setup this communication, please let me know and I will be glad to share it here.
Thanks,Alex
