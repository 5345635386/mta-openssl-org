I wonder if some of the concerns were alleviated if we started using
the GitHub Discussions feature for the user-type questions and general
discussions of OpenSSL. You can subscribe and watch only Discussions on
a GH project - i.e., have notifications of new Discussion topics and
replies to them delivered to your e-mail.

You would not need to subscribe to all the traffic (i.e. the issues
related to development of OpenSSL would be still kept in Issues and
Pull requests). You can also reply to a thread by just replying to the
notification e-mail. So there is actually no need to use a Web browser
to read/reply on those discussions.

Of course that does not remove the requirement to actually have a GH
account. That is still necessary and that might still prevent some
people from participation.
