<PRE>&gt;<i> From: openssl-users &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">openssl-users-bounces at openssl.org</A>&gt; On Behalf Of Tim Hudson
</I>&gt;<i> Sent: Sunday, 19 March, 2023 15:21
</I>
&gt;<i> There is a lot more activity on GitHub and there is a high overlap in the types of items raised
</I>&gt;<i> as issues and the openssl-users mailing list - and it is clear that at least a few of those on the
</I>&gt;<i> openssl-users mailing list aren't participating in GitHub related activity - which means they are
</I>&gt;<i> missing out on the majority of the activity that is happening in the developer community.
</I>
That is not, in itself, a compelling argument for terminating the mailing list. Clearly a number of people prefer the mailing list to GitHub.

&gt;<i> The volume of traffic on openssl-users is small
</I>
This is a bad thing?

&gt;<i> and the number of items raised for which there is no response or there is a response which
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't answer the question is relatively high if you look over the mailing list responses.
</I>
I've been on openssl-users for a month shy of 23 years, and I don't believe that's true &#8211; for well-constructed questions. And, frankly, I don't particularly care about poorly-constructed questions, since learning how to ask good questions is a much more fundamental skill.

&gt;<i> the majority of the developer-contributing community is on GitHub and interacting
</I>
Unfortunately. That doesn't prove GitHub is a good mechanism, for this or any other purpose; only that it's (bafflingly) popular. Its popularity is not an argument for those who prefer the mailing list to switch to it.

&gt;<i> if you won't go to GitHub regularly and simply want to see things in email, then you should be
</I>&gt;<i> watching GitHub issues as you are missing the majority of the interactions
</I>
While I haven't used it extensively or recently, in my experience GitHub's &quot;watch&quot; facility is a poor substitute for a proper mailing list.

&gt;<i> if you are responding to questions and you are not also responding on GitHub and would cease
</I>&gt;<i> to contribute if openssl-users disappeared then please speak up
</I>
I already wrote as much in my first response to this topic. Whether my input is of value is a separate question, of course; but since you ask, I'm unlikely to participate in GitHub discussions. While I have a GitHub account, I rarely use it, and that's already more often than I'd like.
