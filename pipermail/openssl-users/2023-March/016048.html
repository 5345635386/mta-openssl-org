</I>&gt;<i> You have at least a half dozen excellent reasons to continue to support this mailing list, but my case is unique to those previous reasons so I will add it into the mix.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my career (IT Manager) I support many users and applications that use OpenSSL of various implementations. In developing a sane and business oriented support system with a focus on securing our data I discovered it was necessary to learn more about the technology behind SSL/TLS. To &quot;self-learn&quot; something requires a person to know what they don't know. An email newsgroup is a way to help facilitate learning what I don't know in bite size chunks that allows me to retain that knowledge. I might read a question by Bob, Bill or Sam that makes me realize there is a gap in my own knowledge base. Then I might read a response by Tomas, Ralph or Martha that explains the issue in ways I hadn't previously considered. This is the classical educational model at work. It is based upon healthy discussion of the topic. In this mailing list you have a large enough discussion group to maintain this on a regular, daily basis. Please don't through it away.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would postulate a few things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, by even mentioning the dissolution of this list you threaten the long term viability of this list. It would have been better to first look to the members of the list to solve the real problems in the list. What are they?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second, the trickle of quality information delivered to the inbox from a mailing list is difficult to duplicate in other ways (this is a reason they are still used effectively). One could argue RSS is a replacement but it is one switch away from being turned off.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Third, by turning off this list you will lose any participation you might have gained from those of us in the weeds. I won't have time to search through github on a regular basis. I barely have time to read the 10-15 quality emails I get from the list a day.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Keep the list. Keep your non-expert users/admins. Keep educating people in the weeds on how to clean up the areas they find themselves in and let us know how to help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Closing the users (openssl-users) mailing list might not be a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My personal case: as a developer who happens to use OpenSSL (and not an OpenSSL developer), I certainly wouldn't have time and interest to have a look to new ongoing discussions through dedicated web resources.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the general matter: email is an *old* technology on the Internet, one of the oldest for sure, if not *the* oldest, telnet set aside.&#160; It has issues, in relation with its age, which are expectable, acceptable and manageable.&#160; Does this make it evil?&#160; Is replacing email, with countless different web-based forums, groups, systems, of all sorts, really the next invaluable evolutionary step?&#160; Well I may have grown too old, just like email, to see the obvious advantages of loosing my remaining time &quot;online&quot;, visiting countless of various sites, systems, authenticating myself here and there, just to grab the flow of communications which, before, were conveniently delivered straight to my door (my email inbox).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as the focus of the OpenSSL users and developers community is now on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the OpenSSL project GitHub page [1] we are considering closing this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mailing list. We would like to move to using Issues [2] and Pull

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using and developing&#160; OpenSSL in a single location as this provides
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better tracking and searching and we believe this will help us serve

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We would still keep the mailing list read-only so the archives of the
