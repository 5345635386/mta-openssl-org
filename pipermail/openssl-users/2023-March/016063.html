<PRE>Count me in - completely agree with Viktor. I&#8217;ve created my share of GitHub issues, and in the past contributed a few patches - guess, it means my participation was somewhat useful for the project. 

I practically never participate in somebody else&#8217;s GitHub issues. But I did answer a few questions here (and asked a lot more ;). 

If the (idiotic) decision to close  this list does get implemented, I&#8217;m probably switch to another library altogether (thank God f&#252;r Botan and WolfSSL, among others). 

Thanks for listening. 

Regards,
Uri

P.S. Contrary to what Stephen said: if you&#8217;re a member of this list and do not want it to go away - please don&#8217;t worry about the spam factor and send a &#8220;+1&#8221; reply back to the list. Otherwise, &#8220;they&#8221; just won&#8217;t get it, it seems.
