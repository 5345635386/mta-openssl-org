It looks like it is just called once at the end of processing the server's first flight.
The API was clearly designed prior to TLS 1.3 and not modernized as part of the TLS 1.3 implementation;
the updates were pretty minimal (see commit 7776a36cfa5853175a858fa32983f22f36513171 that just generalizes
from &quot;process ServerDone&quot; to &quot;process server's first flight&quot;).

For TLS 1.3 you only get the response for the end-entity certificate; we specifically ignore the extension for other certificates in the chain.

&gt;<i>    3)The OCSP response callback seems to be called after the cert chain
</I>&gt;<i>    verification callback has ended. Is there any reason for this?. The
</I>&gt;<i>    authenticity of OCSP response is established by a different chain  (OCSP
</I>&gt;<i>    response -&gt; CA that signed cert), and doesn't need to wait for the server
</I>&gt;<i>    end entity verification?. So instead of CRL, OCSP could have been used
</I>&gt;<i>    during cert chain verification
</I>
I did not specifically go dig into the VCS history, but in general OpenSSL's
callback interfaces are not part of a intentional wholistic design; most were
added as one-offs to meet a specific purpose and they often can interact with
each other in quite unfortunate ways.  On the server side, many of the
callbacks are mostly superseded by the &quot;client hello callback&quot; that runs very
early and has well-defined interactions with other callbacks (and can act
before libssl has started processing anything), at the cost of needing to do
more parsing of the data by hand.  That doesn't help you here, of course; if
you need to see all the OCSP responses you will probably need to use a message
callback (SSL_CTX_set_msg_callback()) in order to get access to the
multi-staple.
