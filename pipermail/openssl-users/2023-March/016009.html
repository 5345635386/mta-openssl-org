<PRE>Hello,


Can you please tell me which version of openssl supports RSA encrypt/decrypt operation with OAEP SHA256 padding and MGF1 mask generation.


On my dev box...

$ cat /etc/system-release
CentOS release 6.10 (Final)

$ openssl version
OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013

$ readlink -f /usr/lib/libssl.so.6
/usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.8e
$ readlink -f /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.6
/usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8e




Thanks,

Viken Kondakji
