There are only 2 places I've ever used: the mailing list and github. 
What other &quot;many places&quot; are you referring to?

FWIW I find the mailing list to be very useful and strongly favour 
keeping it.
It is very convenient to scan the ML emails in my inbox as they arrive 
and far less convenient to bring up github in a browser and scan the 
issues list.
I strongly suspect discontinuing the ML will cause your audience size to 
drop drastically.

That said, I do see some overlap between the ML and the issues page on 
github, so perhaps all you need to do is clarify the purpose of each.
IMHO: use the ML for questions and discussions and github for bugs 
reports, feature requests and code (PRs).
