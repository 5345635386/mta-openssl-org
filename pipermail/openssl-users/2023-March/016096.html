There is no community vote process. This is a business decision that
smells like management doing something for some other reason that the
public will never know. It smacks of the FreeNODE irc service disaster.

If the OpenSSL project has management people and a management decision
process that is open and available to the larger user community then
maybe you have a leg to stand on. Otherwise this is nothing but hot air
where you are pandering to some sense of &quot;community&quot;.

I am not buying a word that you say. Nothing. I have seen this all done
before and I smell some back room politics in place. Don't try to sell
me a can of rotten fish while talking about how great it is. Baloney.

I think WolfSSL is a good direction to go and I won't have any more of
your nonsense marketing.
