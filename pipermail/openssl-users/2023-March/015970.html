<PRE>Hi Akshath,

I don't know of any APIs provided by OpenSSL for parsing the Certificate message
(the ones I think you found for the ClientHello are specific to the context of the
client_hello callback I mentioned, and even they leave a fair amount of parsing to the caller).

The internal parser code is roughly at
<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/ssl/statem/statem_clnt.c#L1853">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/ssl/statem/statem_clnt.c#L1853</A>
but extracting it for standalone use would require a fair bit of effort and
understanding of the wire protocol.  I do recommend using an abstraction for counted
byte buffers akin to the PACKET_* APIs here (or boringssl's CBB APIs) to avoid buffer
overflow attacks when parsing.

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    On the client side I'm adding  &quot;certificate status request&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>      extension to
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    ClientHello message. For server, Im using an apache httpd server
</I>&gt;<i>      which has
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    OCSP responder details configured in ssl module. THe negotiated TLS
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    version is 1.3
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    1)The server has a multi tier cert chain. But it seems to be
</I>&gt;<i>      sending the
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    OCSP response for only the end entity certificate. Apache
</I>&gt;<i>      documentation
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    seems to suggest this is expected and multi-stapling is not
</I>&gt;<i>      supported. Is
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    anyone aware of a http server that supports multi-stapling?
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    2)On the client side, I'm registering for the OCSP response
</I>&gt;<i>      callback with
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_status_cb.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    In case of a multi tiered cert chain and OCSP response for each
</I>&gt;<i>      cert, is
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    this callback called once for each response?, or only one time?
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    If its called only only one time, how are the responses accessed?
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    SSL_get_tlsext_status_ocsp_response -&gt; seems to return only one
</I>&gt;<i>      OCSP
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    response.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    And I haven't been able to try tis for the lack of multi-stapling
</I>&gt;<i>      support
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    in http server
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      It looks like it is just called once at the end of processing the
</I>&gt;<i>      server's first flight.
</I>&gt;<i>      The API was clearly designed prior to TLS 1.3 and not modernized as part
</I>&gt;<i>      of the TLS 1.3 implementation;
</I>&gt;<i>      the updates were pretty minimal (see commit
</I>&gt;<i>      7776a36cfa5853175a858fa32983f22f36513171 that just generalizes
</I>&gt;<i>      from &quot;process ServerDone&quot; to &quot;process server's first flight&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      For TLS 1.3 you only get the response for the end-entity certificate; we
</I>&gt;<i>      specifically ignore the extension for other certificates in the chain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    3)The OCSP response callback seems to be called after the cert
</I>&gt;<i>      chain
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    verification callback has ended. Is there any reason for this?. The
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    authenticity of OCSP response is established by a different chain 
</I>&gt;<i>      (OCSP
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    response -&gt; CA that signed cert), and doesn't need to wait for the
</I>&gt;<i>      server
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    end entity verification?. So instead of CRL, OCSP could have been
</I>&gt;<i>      used
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;    during cert chain verification
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      I did not specifically go dig into the VCS history, but in general
</I>&gt;<i>      OpenSSL's
</I>&gt;<i>      callback interfaces are not part of a intentional wholistic design; most
</I>&gt;<i>      were
</I>&gt;<i>      added as one-offs to meet a specific purpose and they often can interact
</I>&gt;<i>      with
</I>&gt;<i>      each other in quite unfortunate ways.  On the server side, many of the
</I>&gt;<i>      callbacks are mostly superseded by the &quot;client hello callback&quot; that runs
</I>&gt;<i>      very
</I>&gt;<i>      early and has well-defined interactions with other callbacks (and can
</I>&gt;<i>      act
</I>&gt;<i>      before libssl has started processing anything), at the cost of needing
</I>&gt;<i>      to do
</I>&gt;<i>      more parsing of the data by hand.  That doesn't help you here, of
</I>&gt;<i>      course; if
</I>&gt;<i>      you need to see all the OCSP responses you will probably need to use a
</I>&gt;<i>      message
</I>&gt;<i>      callback (SSL_CTX_set_msg_callback()) in order to get access to the
</I>&gt;<i>      multi-staple.
