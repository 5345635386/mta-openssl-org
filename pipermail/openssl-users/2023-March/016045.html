If github's issues page is used for general user
support, rather than for bug reports (as intended),
does that mean that you shouldn't ever close any
issues?

If issues do get closed, it would make it even more
tedious for users to search for their own question
before asking it (they'd have to search open and closed
issues, and they'd have to know that they have to do
that).

If issues don't get closed, how could the developers
easily tell which issues are bugs that aren't fixed yet
versus &quot;issues&quot; that are user support and discussion?
It doesn't look good to have an ever-increasing number
of open issues.

cheers,
raf
