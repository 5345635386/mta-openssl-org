That i did not understand.  Where is the difference in between
a graphical window with github notifications (that i never have
seen) and a -issue only mailbox looked at in a graphical mail
viewer?

I would have understood &quot;it is all nicely scripted and there is
nothing much to do except clicking around&quot;.  Ok.
(The emacs community now seems to have implemented a plain text
format which offers this :-))

(I personally was &quot;shocked&quot; to see that the trivial patch
i &quot;issue&quot;d caused lots of VM spin ups and needless test runs.
The only &quot;ok&quot; from my side is that OpenSSL is so critical to the
entire infrastructure .. of the internet as such .., but such
a waste of energy, i would rather not cause automatically.
Isn't that &quot;too fat&quot;?  I mean it saves you as a developer one
&quot;test-compile this&quot; click, shall github offer such
differentiations.)

Now .. all this could be implemented by replying to an issue email
with a specific tag that the ML software filters out.
Of course: that had to be done.

But you are the developers, and you have chosen this way.
So it may be.

 |I've generally stopped signing up on mailing lists, and am slowly

 |painful endeavour to look at.

That i buy, too.  Of course.  The dnsmasq developer said something
like &quot;[i] do not read the emails for some time, but it distracts
me from coding&quot;.  That felt familiar.  (And not to talk about so
many things and standards that really should be read in addition.)

 |I do still occasionally respond on this ML, when a subject line gets

 |goes for most projects I keep an eye on, so I have a gitlab.com tab
 |as well for the few that I follow that are there)

I am always happy when i can quit the browser so that the
containment goes home.  Here i have &quot;4:37&#176;/1:42&#176; | 0.26 1/246&quot;,
and a display brightness of 3%.  But i am only from a very small
corner of the software infrastructure, indeed.
