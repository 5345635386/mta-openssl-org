A major problem with only having github as opposed to a
mailing list is that github is a website, so it's a
place that you need to go to. Mail just arrives. People
can participate in mailing lists for many different
projects (even if it's just staying aware of news and
issues and questions) every efficiently via email. With
github, participation would require active separate
conscious activity for each project that you are
interested in. It's inefficient. Also, github issues
aren't really suited to questions or users helping each
other, they are for reporting bugs. Not everything is a
bug report. Also, with a mailing list, more people are
potentially available to answer questions. With github,
it'll probably end up only being the developers
answering questions. Of course, all of the above statements
are really opinions. I have no evidence. :-)

Also, people can only ask questions on github if they
have a github account. All that is required to ask a
question on a mailing list is an email account. There
are many more people with email accounts than there are
with github accounts. Not all users of software are
themselves software developers.
