This entire thread of discussion feels like some marketing people sat
down and made the unilateral decision to just close the maillist for
ordinary users such as myself. No amount of discussion will mean
anything as there is no vote and no decison process that involves the
actual people affected.  This is not a &quot;community&quot; process. It is just a
business move.

Words like &quot;small set of feedback&quot; is a token throw away phrase that
also means nothing at all. The decision has already been made and for
some obscure reason the same foolish marketing people made the next bad
move : to tell people.

Simply pull the plug in the middle of the night and let people whine
from a safe distance. That is how business is done and Microsoft and
Oracle are experts at this. The &quot;users&quot; do not matter. They never did.
