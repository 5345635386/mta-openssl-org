Interesting.  I'm a contributor to a project which takes the opposite
view.  Its developer ML is essentially abandoned in favor of Github,
but the user lists are active and one is encouraged to use them for
local issues and general questions.

From time to time we get a Github issue &quot;how would I do thusandso&quot; or
&quot;I can't make this work,&quot; but these are closed and the poster is
gently advised to use the MLs for questions and usage assistance.  The
community is quite responsive, but anything that isn't likely to lead
to patching the stock code is kept out of Github.  OTOH feature
requests and bug fixes on the MLs are redirected *to* Github.

I think that a lot of people would see the developer and user contexts
as quite different, with different natural communication styles, work
flow, and record keeping requirements.
