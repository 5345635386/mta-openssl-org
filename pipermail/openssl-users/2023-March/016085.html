</I>Yep.

A few times I've asked questions on the list; as a developer who uses 
this library on a fairly routine basis I've got code out there that is 
both pretty current and that which was compiled on platforms and OS 
versions that are not anywhere near current -- and for various reasons 
beyond my control never will be.

Will I take such questions to Github in the future if this goes away?&#160; 
No.&#160; I can (and do) scan the new messages on this list daily as its 
fast, easy, and in one place and in /many /cases that has alerted me to 
something I need to pay attention to.&#160; I'm one of the &quot;mostly-silents&quot; 
who nonetheless take the information from discussions here /and use it, 
/in many cases narrowing security issues or understanding whether a 
particular problem is of importance to said software or not, and if it 
is, whether it can be successfully mitigated or not.&#160; I don't have to 
open a web browser and dig through things; it comes straight to my 
inbox. Some may see this as archaic but I see it as beneficial to my 
workflow, and the potential alternative isn't.
