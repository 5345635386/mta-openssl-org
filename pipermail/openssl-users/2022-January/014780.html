I think changing the description of EVP_PKEY_get_int_param to something
like:

  EVP_PKEY_get_int_param() retrieves a key pkey integer value *out
  associated with a name of key_name. This function might fail if the
  number is too large too fit, so for some parameters you should use
  (or retry with) EVP_PKEY_get_bn_param.

Might suffice? To give some additional context (since I'm the original
poster): I definitely did read the man pages. I've really tried to
understand. But the fact the `unsigned integer` does not mean `unsigned
int` was totally lost on me.

Even now, when I know what to look for, I have hard time finding the
relevant content in the man page. Sure, I guess this could have been the
correct hint:

  The parameter data is an integer (signed or unsigned) of arbitrary
  length [..]

But I so did not connect the dots there. I think adding into this
paragraph mention then it can be access by both _int_param and _bn_param
(depending on the size) would work as well.

Also it's bit weird that responder *may* choose to return error if
data_size is not suitable. What else it might do? Is it valid (from
responder's point of view) to just truncate the value to that it would
fit into unsigned int (that would obviously be useless behavior, I'm
just curious if it would be compliant based on the man page).

On separate note, my code is now passing the tests when running on
openssl 3.0.1, so thank you very much for the guidance you've provided.
