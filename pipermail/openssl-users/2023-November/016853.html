* Have you considered using TLS resumption for all but the initial
  connection?  If you haven't why not?  If ruled out, why?

* Do you control the software on both ends of the connection?  Or
  do you need to interoperate with other TLS applications you
  cannot change?

* At some point, you might want to use QUIC as the upstream protocol,
  as it supports particulary efficient (lower latency than unencrypted
  TCP) establishment of secondary channels.

* However, QUIC support in OpenSSL is just about to appear in a
  preliminary form in OpenSSL 3.2, and may not yet have all the features
  you'd need.

* In the meantime, just using resumption should get you there,
  and if you control the software on both ends, you can make
  it cheaper by (TLS 1.3) using psk_ke, rather than psk_dhe_ke,
  if the perfmance difference is sufficiently compelling and
  the security tradeoffs are clearly understood.

  With TLS 1.2, resumption is always of the &quot;psk_ke&quot; variety.

The directions you were exploring with alternative bulk ciphers are
entirely non-productive, banish them from your mind, and never
contemplate such things again.
