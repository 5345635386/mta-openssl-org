Yep. I would like us to make our LTS plans a little bit more certain
than this. As we are going to do time based releases starting from 3.3
I think it will be actually possible to make the plans a little bit
more concrete also in regards to LTS.


&gt;<i> I have two observations:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.&#160; Please ensure there is always an LTS release that is in support.
</I>&gt;<i> (If necessary by extending support on the existing LTS.)
</I>
That is already ensured by our policy. We have to declare a new LTS
release every 4 years at the latest and each LTS is supported for 5
years.

&gt;<i> 2.&#160; I would prefer to avoid declaring X.0 an LTS.&#160; If there are
</I>&gt;<i> problems with the API in X.0, a new API can be added in X.1, to
</I>&gt;<i> resolve it.
</I>
3.0 as an LTS was kind of exception. Unfortunately we had to mark some
release as LTS according to our policy and the 3.1 release was not out
yet.
