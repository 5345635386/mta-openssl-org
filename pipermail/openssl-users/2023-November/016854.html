<PRE>&gt;<i> There is no date set for that yet. Not even roughly. The earliest
</I>&gt;<i> release where the engine API can be removed is 4.0 but there was no
</I>&gt;<i> decision on when that version is going to be released and it was not
</I>&gt;<i> even decided which of the deprecated APIs are going to be removed in
</I>&gt;<i> 4.0.
</I>
&gt;<i> The functions deprecated in 3.0 will remain supported in 3.0 until
</I>&gt;<i> 2026-09-07. If there is any further 3.x version designated as LTS, it
</I>&gt;<i> will give the lifetime of these APIs at least further five years. But
</I>&gt;<i> it wasn't decided yet whether there will be another 3.x version
</I>&gt;<i> designated as LTS.
</I>
Thanks.  That provides &quot;rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty&quot;.

I have two observations:

1.  Please ensure there is always an LTS release that is in support.
(If necessary by extending support on the existing LTS.)
2.  I would prefer to avoid declaring X.0 an LTS.  If there are
problems with the API in X.0, a new API can be added in X.1, to
resolve it.
