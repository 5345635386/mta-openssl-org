I have taken my time to answer this, as it deserved
some careful thinking.

The problem over the past year or so is not as much
that any old maintainers have left, as that the entire
project seems to have given off a &quot;vibe&quot; of being
&quot;under new management&quot;.

Specifically, a number of decisions have the feel of
a project that has been co-opted or taken over by
someone eager to make sweeping changes for little
apparent reason, someone with lots of idle lawyers
on hand, like &quot;Microsoft, various corporate partners,
the CII, and/or the SFLC&quot; (using a list from the latest
public blog post), yet seemingly unaware of the dangers
of combining a UK jurisdiction with phrases such as
&quot;the public benefit&quot; in an area of technology which
has historically been subject to much UK government
interference over the past 70 years.

I also see a tendency to throw historical decisions
overboard with little effort to understand why such
decisions might actually be or have been good
decisions.  For instance, in the penultimate blog
post, most of the things removed under &quot;dynamic
memory cleanup&quot; actually serve real purposes:
protective parameter validation against future code
bugs, thus by definition not counted in automated
&quot;coverage tools&quot; (NULL checking before free),
making malloc calls compile with C++ compilers
(casting the return value of malloc to specific
pointer type), forcing compiler errors if variable
types change (that same cast!).


Enjoy
