Modern browsers increasingly presume that such private CAs behave exactly
like the public CAs regulated through the CA/Browsers Forum (CAB/F) and
the per-browser root CA inclusion programs (the administrative processes
that determine which CAs are listed in browsers by default).

Among the relevant requirements now needed:

- Serial numbers are *exactly* 20 bytes (153 to 159 bits) both as 
standalone
  numbers and as DER-encoded numbers.  Note that this is not the default in
  the openssl ca program.

- Serial numbers contain cryptographically strong random bits, currently at
  least 64 random bits, though it is best if the entire serial number looks
  random from the outside.  This is not implemented by the openssl ca 
program.

- Certificates are valid for at most 2 years (actually 825 days).

- SHA-1 (and other weak algorithms such as MD5) are no longer permitted and
  is already disappearing from Browser code.

- RSA shorter than 2048 bits (and other weak settings such as equally short
  DSA keys) are no longer permitted and is already disappearing from 
Browser
  code.

- If the certificate is issued to an e-mail address, that e-mail address 
must
  also be listed as an rfc822Name in a &quot;Subject Alternative Name&quot; 
certificate
  extension.

- End user certificates must be issued from an Intermediary CA whose
  certificate is is in turn issued from a longer term root CA.

- If revocation is implemented (it should be, just in case someone gets 
their
  computer or other key storage hacked/stolen), it needs to support 
OCSP, but
  should ideally do so without having the actual CA keys online 
(standard trick:
  Issue 3-month non-revocable OCSP-signing certificates and provide the
  corresponding private key to the server running the OCSP responder 
program).
   I would recommend to also implement traditional CRLs, since for 
smaller CAs
  it is a better solution for browsers and servers that support it.


Enjoy
