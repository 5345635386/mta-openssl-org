<PRE>Replying personally:

I'm a nobody, and you have no reason to know me - but wanted to thank you for the input you give here.

You're nearly always quite thoughtful, careful in what you say, respectful, and give such [IMO] good insightful feedback and information to people looking for help. I follow quite a number of lists, and IMO, it's a rare breed of individuals who do such a fine job.

Perhaps you care nothing for such accolades, and I'm truly a &quot;nobody&quot; in giving them - but still I wanted to recognize excellence when I see it.

So, Thanks!

-Greg

JB&gt; Modern browsers increasingly presume that such private CAs behave exactly
JB&gt; like the public CAs regulated through the CA/Browsers Forum (CAB/F) and
JB&gt; the per-browser root CA inclusion programs (the administrative processes
JB&gt; that determine which CAs are listed in browsers by default).

JB&gt; Among the relevant requirements now needed:

JB&gt; - Serial numbers are *exactly* 20 bytes (153 to 159 bits) both as 
JB&gt; standalone
JB&gt;   numbers and as DER-encoded numbers.  Note that this is not the default in
JB&gt;   the openssl ca program.

JB&gt; - Serial numbers contain cryptographically strong random bits, currently at
JB&gt;   least 64 random bits, though it is best if the entire serial number looks
JB&gt;   random from the outside.  This is not implemented by the openssl ca 
JB&gt; program.

JB&gt; - Certificates are valid for at most 2 years (actually 825 days).

JB&gt; - SHA-1 (and other weak algorithms such as MD5) are no longer permitted and
JB&gt;   is already disappearing from Browser code.

JB&gt; - RSA shorter than 2048 bits (and other weak settings such as equally short
JB&gt;   DSA keys) are no longer permitted and is already disappearing from 
JB&gt; Browser
JB&gt;   code.

JB&gt; - If the certificate is issued to an e-mail address, that e-mail address
JB&gt; must
JB&gt;   also be listed as an rfc822Name in a &quot;Subject Alternative Name&quot; 
JB&gt; certificate
JB&gt;   extension.

JB&gt; - End user certificates must be issued from an Intermediary CA whose
JB&gt;   certificate is is in turn issued from a longer term root CA.

JB&gt; - If revocation is implemented (it should be, just in case someone gets
JB&gt; their
JB&gt;   computer or other key storage hacked/stolen), it needs to support 
JB&gt; OCSP, but
JB&gt;   should ideally do so without having the actual CA keys online 
JB&gt; (standard trick:
JB&gt;   Issue 3-month non-revocable OCSP-signing certificates and provide the
JB&gt;   corresponding private key to the server running the OCSP responder 
JB&gt; program).
JB&gt;    I would recommend to also implement traditional CRLs, since for 
JB&gt; smaller CAs
JB&gt;   it is a better solution for browsers and servers that support it.


JB&gt; Enjoy
