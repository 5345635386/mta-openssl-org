You .. really have to find that first.  I shamelessly post some
private conversation i had in the past.

I personally (i am the |&gt; quote above) find it a pity that the
really nice SSL_CONF_cmd and SSL_CTX_config seem to be second
class citizens, that anyhow do not seem to spread to forks.
Btw, you surely have heard

  Modified files:
          lib/libssl     : ssl.h

  Log message:
  Add #defines and prototypes for security level API

  This marks the start of one of the worst API additions in the history of
  this library. And as everybody knows the bar is high. Very high.
