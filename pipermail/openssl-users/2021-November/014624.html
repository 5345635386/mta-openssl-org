<PRE>I don't use Brew. I've installed OpenSSL-1.1.1 (and 3.0.0) via Macports, and have no problem linking and running apps against 1.1.1.

There are two ways to design a system. One is to make is so simple there are obviously no deficiencies.
The other is to make it so complex there are no obvious deficiencies.

    and you're sure it's trying to load the libcrypto of the OpenSSL 1.1.1, 
    not,
    for example a 0.9.8 version of it?

    &gt;&gt; I'm trying to get my application that uses openSSL 1.1 running 
    &gt;&gt; on OSX. I've
    &gt;&gt; installed them using homebrew, but I can't get past Apple's gates around
    &gt;&gt; blocking use of openSSL.
    &gt;
    &gt; I don't think they're actively doing blocking here, though I could
    &gt; perhaps be wrong...
    &gt;
    &gt;&gt; I've copied both dylibs into my app /Contents/MacOS folder, and signed
    &gt;&gt; both of them, and I load them from the that location, but OSX still
    &gt;&gt; blocks loading.
    &gt;
    &gt; More accurately I think, the libraries fail to load.
    &gt;
    &gt;&gt; It actually blocks loading libssl.1.1.dylib, with a message 
    &gt;&gt; about libcrypto
    &gt;&gt; - presumably libssl has a non-version dependence on libcrypto that OSX is
    &gt;&gt; blocking?
    &gt;
    &gt; The problem is likely that &quot;libssl&quot; not built to locate &quot;libcrypto&quot;
    &gt; relative to its own location, but rather expects to find it at a fixed
    &gt; location.  This would be some MacOS-specific instance of setting the
    &gt; runpath to $ORIGIN on ELF systems.
    &gt;
    &gt; With OpenSSL installed at a fixed location, OpenSSL is working just
    &gt; fine for me (and of course in HomeBrew, ...).
    &gt;
    &gt; So the issue most probably the inability of &quot;libssl.dylib&quot; to find
    &gt; &quot;libcrypt.dylib&quot;, not because of some policy enforcement by Apple's
    &gt; evil overlords, but simply because the runtime linker does not
    &gt; expect to look in the location where you have libcrypt installed.
    &gt;
    &gt; The only thing that gives me some pause is Whether or not notarisation
    &gt; also complicates relocation, but presumably applications can ship
    &gt; shared libraries with the application code without running into
    &gt; major obstacles.
    &gt;
    &gt; Perhaps the presence of LibreSSL on MacOS is another complication,
    &gt; but that libssl and libcrypt should have different version suffixes,
    &gt; and should not get in the way, provided that MacOS has something
    &gt; akin to symbol versioning, to allow separate API versions of the
    &gt; same library to exist in a process side by side without getting
    &gt; in each other's way.
    &gt;
    &gt; If the symbol namespace in MacOS is &quot;flat&quot;, then you may indeed
    &gt; run into trouble because of symbol conflicts between the real
    &gt; OpenSSL and the LibreSSL fork.
    &gt;
    &gt; Good luck.
