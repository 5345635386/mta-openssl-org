<PRE>Setup of the non_fips_libctx (after help from this list a week or two ago):

    non_fips_libctx = OSSL_LIB_CTX_new();
    defp = OSSL_PROVIDER_load(non_fips_libctx, &quot;default&quot;);

I also call

OSSL_PROVIDER_available(non_fips_libctx, &quot;default&quot;)

...to verify this worked. I only load the default provider in the non-FIPS non-default library context.

In case you need this info, for the fips library context, I call:

OSSL_LIB_CTX_load_config(fips_libctx, &quot;/usr/local/ssl/openssl-fips.cnf&quot;)

With the following relevant info in openssl-fips-cnf:

.include /usr/local/ssl/fipsmodule.cnf

[openssl_init]
providers = provider_sect

# List of providers to load
[provider_sect]
default = default_sect
# The fips section name should match the section name inside the
# included fipsmodule.cnf.
fips = fips_sect
base = base_sect

# If no providers are activated explicitly, the default one is activated implicitly.
# See man 7 OSSL_PROVIDER-default for more details.
#
# If you add a section explicitly activating any other provider(s), you most
# probably need to explicitly activate the default provider, otherwise it
# becomes unavailable in openssl.  As a consequence applications depending on
# OpenSSL may not work correctly which could lead to significant system
# problems including inability to remotely access the system.
[default_sect]
# activate = 1

[base_sect]
activate = 1

And in fipsmodule.cnf:

[fips_sect]
activate = 1
conditional-errors = 1
security-checks = 1
module-mac = E4:0D:C8:C3:1E:DB:2B:30:E6:F2:49:7B:F5:BD:10:5C:9A:2B:CC:C1:33:49:31:B5:C5:AF:50:AB:82:1E:AE:C9

Also verifying this worked with the following:

OSSL_PROVIDER_available(fips_libctx, &quot;base&quot;)
OSSL_PROVIDER_available(fips_libctx, &quot;fips&quot;)


For setting up the trusted store, when the application starts, it calls:

ssl_trusted_certs = X509_STORE_new()

...and then reads all of the certificates in /etc/ssl/certs/ calling

X509_STORE_add_cert(trusted_store,cert);

..for each one.

Then, I make the following calls to set up intermediate certs in the trust store to be treated as trust-anchors:

        param = X509_VERIFY_PARAM_new();
        X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags(param, X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN);
        X509_STORE_set1_param(ssl_trusted_certs, param);
        X509_VERIFY_PARAM_free(param);

Then I set the store for verifying peer certs to this &quot;global&quot; store I created above:

        status = SSL_CTX_set1_verify_cert_store(ctx,ssl_trusted_certs);

For the sake of completeness, I also call:

    status = SSL_CTX_set1_chain_cert_store(ctx, ssl_trusted_certs);

...to ensure OpenSSL has access to the entire store for forming a certificate chain to present to the peer in a handshake. My application can act as a client and/or a server, and in this case, it's acting as both the client and the server, with the same SSL_CTX. Also, this code has always worked with OpenSSL 1.1.1, which is why I was suspicious of either my library context/provider setup, or 3.0.

Let me know if you need more info.

Thanks,

Jason

How do you set up the non_fips_libctx and how do you set up any
certificate trust store within the SSL_CTX?
