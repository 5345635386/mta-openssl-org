Ahh, thank you. That makes sense.

Would a patch that updates s_client&#8217;s verbiage be accepted? It seems like, when TLS 1.3 is in play, the note about secure renegotiation should either be omitted or altered to mention that renegotiation support is a non-issue for this TLS version.

It also seems like the SECURE RENEGOTIATION section of OpenSSL&#8217;s docs could use a bit of update to mention that it&#8217;s only relevant for 1.2 and prior?

Related: apparently some security-scanning tools flag any client renegotiation support as a potential vulnerability. Apparently about 10 years back it came out that renegotiations were more expensive on the server than on the client, as a result of which it was possible for a client to run a denial-of-service attack by issuing renegotiation requests over and over. Is this still an issue, or is it something that newer OpenSSLs effectively mitigate?

Thank you again!

Cheers,
