<PRE>I'm also a bit confused at how this became the limiting factor for the application
in question.

<A HREF="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-emu-eaptlscert-08">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-emu-eaptlscert-08</A> has some
discussion of how large certificates can cause issues for EAP (as well as some
guidance to EAP deployments as to how to reduce the scale of the issues), which
suggests that most of the time there is already some buffering going on at
a 1-2k chunk size just based on the limits of the EAP exchange's MTU.  (The
parties in the exchange have to transmit one chunk at a time and get an ACK
back before transmitting the next chunk, and once that handshake flight is
finished the process is reversed with the other party sending a chunk at a time.)
A BIO-layer buffer would be between that and the libssl handshake buffering,
and as you describe, it should still get the data through, just maybe with
a slight inefficiency.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Either way, the effect of the buffering BIO during writes is that a 4k

</I>&gt;<i> (except for efficiency) although it does depend on what happens &quot;downstream&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> of the buffering bio and how partial writes get sent to the peer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds like things are not quite working correctly for you when &quot;partial&quot;
