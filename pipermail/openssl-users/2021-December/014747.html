<PRE>@Philip,

it should not be hard to copy the core code from apps/req.c and cut out 
all parts not needed for generating a PKCS#10 CSR (including its 
self-signature).
Yet beware that a general-purpose library function that has (at least) 
the flexibility offered by that app would need a non-trivial set of 
parameters.

I do not like to separate the code sections that handle the alternative 
case of generating a self-signed cert
because there are strong similarities with generating a PKCS#10 CSR, so 
a split would introduce quite some redundancy.
(The code would deserve some further cleanup, but this is a general 
issue that holds for many, if not all, those apps.)

@Kyle,

your comments regarding the (self-)signature key to be used for CSR 
signing vs. cert signing are not really to the point being asked.

Also your comments on OpenSSL library code size are a side topic here, 
though I fully agree that it would be great if
the crypto lib was relieved from much bulk (to which various people 
including myself have added quite a bit recently)
that would much better fit in higher-level library. I suggested 
&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/4992">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/4992</A>&gt; this 4 years back, but so 
far the project members have not
found time for this. Later I re-phrased the issue later as a major FR: 
<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/13440">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/13440</A> 
&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/13440">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/13440</A>&gt;

Regards,
