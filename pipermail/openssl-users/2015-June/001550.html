OpenSSL Security Advisory [11 Jun 2015]
=======================================

DHE man-in-the-middle protection (Logjam)
====================================================================

A vulnerability in the TLS protocol allows a man-in-the-middle
attacker to downgrade vulnerable TLS connections using ephemeral
Diffie-Hellman key exchange to 512-bit export-grade cryptography. This
vulnerability is known as Logjam (CVE-2015-4000).

OpenSSL has added protection for TLS clients by rejecting handshakes
with DH parameters shorter than 768 bits. This limit will be increased
to 1024 bits in a future release.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2b
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1n

Fixes for this issue were developed by Emilia K&#195;&#164;sper and Kurt Roeckx
of the OpenSSL development team.

Malformed ECParameters causes infinite loop (CVE-2015-1788)
===========================================================

Severity: Moderate

When processing an ECParameters structure OpenSSL enters an infinite loop if
the curve specified is over a specially malformed binary polynomial field.

This can be used to perform denial of service against any
system which processes public keys, certificate requests or
certificates.  This includes TLS clients and TLS servers with
client authentication enabled.

This issue affects OpenSSL versions: 1.0.2 and 1.0.1. Recent
1.0.0 and 0.9.8 versions are not affected. 1.0.0d and 0.9.8r and below are
affected.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2b
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1n
OpenSSL 1.0.0d (and below) users should upgrade to 1.0.0s
OpenSSL 0.9.8r (and below) users should upgrade to 0.9.8zg

This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 6th April 2015 by Joseph Birr-Pixton. The
fix was developed by Andy Polyakov of the OpenSSL development team.

Exploitable out-of-bounds read in X509_cmp_time (CVE-2015-1789)
===============================================================

Severity: Moderate

X509_cmp_time does not properly check the length of the ASN1_TIME
string and can read a few bytes out of bounds. In addition,
X509_cmp_time accepts an arbitrary number of fractional seconds in the
time string.

An attacker can use this to craft malformed certificates and CRLs of
various sizes and potentially cause a segmentation fault, resulting in
a DoS on applications that verify certificates or CRLs. TLS clients
that verify CRLs are affected. TLS clients and servers with client
authentication enabled may be affected if they use custom verification
callbacks.

This issue affects all current OpenSSL versions: 1.0.2, 1.0.1, 1.0.0 and 0.9.8.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2b
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1n
OpenSSL 1.0.0 users should upgrade to 1.0.0s
OpenSSL 0.9.8 users should upgrade to 0.9.8zg

This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 8th April 2015 by Robert Swiecki
(Google), and independently on 11th April 2015 by Hanno B&#195;&#182;ck. The fix
was developed by Emilia K&#195;&#164;sper of the OpenSSL development team.

PKCS7 crash with missing EnvelopedContent (CVE-2015-1790)
=========================================================

Severity: Moderate

The PKCS#7 parsing code does not handle missing inner EncryptedContent
correctly. An attacker can craft malformed ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blobs
with missing content and trigger a NULL pointer dereference on parsing.

Applications that decrypt PKCS#7 data or otherwise parse PKCS#7
structures from untrusted sources are affected. OpenSSL clients and
servers are not affected.

This issue affects all current OpenSSL versions: 1.0.2, 1.0.1, 1.0.0 and 0.9.8.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2b
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1n
OpenSSL 1.0.0 users should upgrade to 1.0.0s
OpenSSL 0.9.8 users should upgrade to 0.9.8zg

This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 18th April 2015 by  Michal
Zalewski (Google). The fix was developed by Emilia K&#195;&#164;sper of the
OpenSSL development team.

CMS verify infinite loop with unknown hash function (CVE-2015-1792)
===================================================================

Severity: Moderate

When verifying a signedData message the CMS code can enter an infinite loop
if presented with an unknown hash function OID.

This can be used to perform denial of service against any system which
verifies signedData messages using the CMS code.

This issue affects all current OpenSSL versions: 1.0.2, 1.0.1, 1.0.0 and 0.9.8.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2b
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1n
OpenSSL 1.0.0 users should upgrade to 1.0.0s
OpenSSL 0.9.8 users should upgrade to 0.9.8zg

This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 31st March 2015 by Johannes Bauer. The
fix was developed by Dr. Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL development team.

Race condition handling NewSessionTicket (CVE-2015-1791)
========================================================

Severity: Low

If a NewSessionTicket is received by a multi-threaded client when attempting to
reuse a previous ticket then a race condition can occur potentially leading to
a double free of the ticket data.

This issue affects all current OpenSSL versions: 1.0.2, 1.0.1, 1.0.0 and 0.9.8.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2b
OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1n
OpenSSL 1.0.0 users should upgrade to 1.0.0s
OpenSSL 0.9.8 users should upgrade to 0.9.8zg

This issue was discovered by Emilia K&#195;&#164;sper of the OpenSSL development team. The
fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.

Invalid free in DTLS (CVE-2014-8176)
====================================

Severity: Moderate

This vulnerability does not affect current versions of OpenSSL. It
existed in previous OpenSSL versions and was fixed in June 2014.

If a DTLS peer receives application data between the ChangeCipherSpec
and Finished messages, buffering of such data may cause an invalid
free, resulting in a segmentation fault or potentially, memory
corruption.

This issue affected older OpenSSL versions 1.0.1, 1.0.0 and 0.9.8.

OpenSSL 0.9.8 DTLS users should upgrade to 0.9.8za
OpenSSL 1.0.0 DTLS users should upgrade to 1.0.0m.
OpenSSL 1.0.1 DTLS users should upgrade to 1.0.1h.

This issue was originally reported on March 28th 2014 in
<A HREF="https://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3286">https://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3286</A> by Praveen
Kariyanahalli, and subsequently by Ivan Fratric and Felix Groebert
(Google). A fix was developed by zhu qun-ying.

The fix for this issue can be identified by commits bcc31166 (1.0.1),
b79e6e3a (1.0.0) and 4b258e73 (0.9.8).

Note
====

As per our previous announcements and our Release Strategy
(<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/about/releasestrat.html">https://www.openssl.org/about/releasestrat.html</A>), support for OpenSSL versions
1.0.0 and 0.9.8 will cease on 31st December 2015. No security updates for these
releases will be provided after that date. Users of these releases are advised
to upgrade.
