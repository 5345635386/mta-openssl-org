</I>Hi Matt,

thanks for the clarification and for the hints.

I've started looking into filters and I have some doubts, though, also
taking into account what you suggested, and I apologize again if this turns
out to be silly. As far as I've understood, what I should do is changing
the current pattern I use for outgoing packets:

      application &lt; memBIO &lt; ssl

to something like this:

      application &lt; memBIO &lt; filter &lt; ssl

or this:

      application &lt; filter &lt; memBIO &lt; ssl

that is, a new BIO filter that enforces the fragmentation I talked about.
Not exactly sure about which one should be the way to go, but I've given
this some thought.

The first one seems conceptually correct, in the sense that the filter
receives the properly sized packets from the stack; I see issues in how to
progressively make them available to the memBIO, though, especially
considering that we cannot &quot;relay&quot; a BIO_read call (that is, have the mem
BIO ask for data to the next BIO in the chain when data is requested). My
guess, looking at the BIOs code, is that this is all asynchronous, that is,
the DTLS stack issues a BIO_write that reaches the filter, and then it's
the filter that forwards the written data (modified or not) to the next
BIO, in this case the mem one, using another BIO_write. My concern here is
how to figure out when to issue such a write: in fact, if we want to make
sure that the mem BIO never returns too much data when a BIO_read is
issued, we should never issue a new BIO_write to feed it with new data from
the filter until the previous one has been read, something we cannot do if
we don't know when the data has been read in the first place.

The second one, as a consequence, may actually be more suited for the
purpose, as we can always only return what we want to in a BIO_read. The
issue there is what I mentioned in my previous post, that is, my fear being
that the memBIO could feed too much data to my filter in a BIO_write, which
would force my filter to inspect the payload and manually split packets as
I'd do in my application. But according to what you said at the beginning
of your reply, this shouldn't be the case, right? That is, the DTLS stack
will issue different BIO_writes towards the memBIO for each
packet/fragment, and this would automatically we forwarded to my filter, am
I correct? Since in this case there wouldn't be any explicit BIO_read done
from the application that may return what's been buffered so far.

Apologies if I'm adding confusion with these questions, I'm just trying to
figure out the best approach to the new filter. As an alternative, I guess
I could just extend the existing mem BIO to a new, custom BIO, and handle
it all there, but my feeling is that a filter would be a cleaner way to do
that.

Thanks again!
Lorenzo
