</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; first of all, apologies if this has been asked before. I've searched
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; archives pretty much everywhere, and only came to partial indications as
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; to how this should be dealt with.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; The problem I'm facing deals with using DTLS with mem BIOs, as I have to
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; take care of transport myself. Specifically, I've implemented a WebRTC
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; gateway called Janus, which means all the connectivity related stuff is
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; delegated to another library (libnice in this case). This mostly works
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; great (kudos to you guys!), but I have problems as soon as packets
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; exceed the MTU, which can easily happen whenever, for instance, you try
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; to handshake with certificates larger than 1024 bits. I read around that
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; the DTLS stack in OpenSSL automatically deals with this, and in fact
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; this seems to be happening: what isn't working is the BIO mem part of this.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; More specifically, OpenSSL does indeed take care of fragmenting the
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; packets according to what is assumed to be the MTU (1472 by default, or
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; the value as set in s-&gt;d1-&gt;mtu). The problem is that the mem BIO ignores
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; that fragmentation info completely, and so, when you do an BIO_read,
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; makes available at the application the whole packet anyway. This results
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; in the whole buffer being passed to nice_agent_send (the method libnice
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; exposes to send packets), which means it's just as not fragmenting
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; anything: the packet is too large and the network drops it. You can
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; verify this by using, e.g., a 4096 bits certificate, and capture the
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; DTLS traffic with Wireshark: you'll see that the message is recognized
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; as composed of not only multiple messages, but also fragments.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; Is there any way I can force the BIO to return the invididual
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; fragments/messages when I do a BIO_read, so that I can send properly
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; sized packets? I've tried looking around but found no insight on how to
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; do that. The only approach that came to my mind was to manually inspect
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; the buffer that is returned, and split messages/fragments myself, but
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; I'd rather avoid delving within the specifics of the protocol if possible.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; Thanks in advance for any help you may provide me with!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Hmmmm. An interesting problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The issue is that a mem BIO has no knowledge of datagram semantics
</I>&gt;<i>     (perhaps we need to add something for OpenSSL 1.1.0).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In a dgram BIO each BIO_write translates to a single datagram being
</I>&gt;<i>     produced. In a mem BIO you just have a big bucket of memory, and every
</I>&gt;<i>     time you get a BIO_write you just add the data onto the end of
</I>&gt;<i>     everything that we've go so far, and so the packet boundaries are not
</I>&gt;<i>     respected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     How about you create a custom filter BIO? All it would need to do is
</I>&gt;<i>     proxy all calls down to the underlying mem BIO. Along the way though it
</I>&gt;<i>     could take note of where the packet boundaries are, so when you call
</I>&gt;<i>     BIO_read it only gives it to you a datagram at a time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Matt
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the very quick answer!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your suggestion does indeed make much more sense that manually inspecting the buffer as I thought of, as you don't need to know anything about the protocol but
</I>&gt;<i> only to be ready to index the packets you see passing by. I never tried writing a BIO filter but there's a first time for everything :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just one quick question about this: are messages/packets passed to the BIO actually splitted, and then just queued by the mem BIO in the buffer, or can there be
</I>&gt;<i> cases where a larger than normal buffer is passed to the BIO anyway, meaning a manual splitting could be needed nevertheless from time to time?
</I>&gt;<i>

hey,


I just want to point out that we have been using OpenSSL in the libre stack for
a long time, with successful deployment.


the DTLS code is here:

<A HREF="http://www.creytiv.com/doxygen/re-dox/html/tls__udp_8c_source.html">http://www.creytiv.com/doxygen/re-dox/html/tls__udp_8c_source.html</A>


we are using 2 different BIOs; one for outgoing, one for incoming:



	tc-&gt;sbio_in = BIO_new(BIO_s_mem());
	if (!tc-&gt;sbio_in) {
		ERR_clear_error();
		err = ENOMEM;
		goto out;
	}

	tc-&gt;sbio_out = BIO_new(&amp;bio_udp_send);
	if (!tc-&gt;sbio_out) {
		ERR_clear_error();
		BIO_free(tc-&gt;sbio_in);
		err = ENOMEM;
		goto out;
	}
