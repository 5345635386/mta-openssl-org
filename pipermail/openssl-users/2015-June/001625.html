<PRE>Hello OpenSSL folks,

We have a product which is an OpenSSL 1.0.1 application. One of my customers
is running my product on his SunSparc Solaris 11 platform which has a Crypto
Accelerator. Around the end of last year, he complained to me that OpenSSL
doesn't utilize the accelerator at all. I then checked on OpenSSL website
and found the following description. 

Changes between 1.0.1e and 1.0.2 [xx XXX xxxx] 

  *) Initial support for PowerISA 2.0.7, first implemented in POWER8. 
     This covers AES, SHA256/512 and GHASH. &quot;Initial&quot; means that most 
     common cases are optimized and there still is room for further 
     improvements. Vector Permutation AES for Altivec is also added. 
     [Andy Polyakov] 

  *) Add support for little-endian ppc64 Linux target. 
     [Marcelo Cerri (IBM)] 

  *) Initial support for AMRv8 ISA crypto extensions. This covers AES, 
     SHA1, SHA256 and GHASH. &quot;Initial&quot; means that most common cases 
     are optimized and there still is room for further improvements. 
     Both 32- and 64-bit modes are supported. 
     [Andy Polyakov, Ard Biesheuvel (Linaro)] 

  *) Improved ARMv7 NEON support. 
     [Andy Polyakov] 

  *) Support for SPARC Architecture 2011 crypto extensions, first 
     implemented in SPARC T4. This covers AES, DES, Camellia, SHA1, 
     SHA256/512, MD5, GHASH and modular exponentiation. 
     [Andy Polyakov, David Miller] 

Hence I told him to wait until OpenSSL 1.0.2 to be released officially. I
promised him I would upgrade the OpenSSL used in my product to 1.0.2, so his
crypto accelerator would be utilized. He came back to me recently as OpenSSL
1.0.2 has been released officially. However after checking change log of
1.0.2, 1.0.2a, 1.0.2b and 1.0.2c, I could not find any description regarding
to 'Support for SPARC Architecture 2011 crypto extensions'. 

My question is if the support for SPARC architecture crypto extensions has
been Implemented yet? 

Thanks in advance, 
Aaron
