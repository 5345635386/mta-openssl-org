Hmmmm. An interesting problem.

The issue is that a mem BIO has no knowledge of datagram semantics
(perhaps we need to add something for OpenSSL 1.1.0).

In a dgram BIO each BIO_write translates to a single datagram being
produced. In a mem BIO you just have a big bucket of memory, and every
time you get a BIO_write you just add the data onto the end of
everything that we've go so far, and so the packet boundaries are not
respected.

How about you create a custom filter BIO? All it would need to do is
proxy all calls down to the underlying mem BIO. Along the way though it
could take note of where the packet boundaries are, so when you call
BIO_read it only gives it to you a datagram at a time.
