<PRE>Many thanks for the answer.

I should have been more specific on the requirements right away. The 
&quot;file&quot; was really just an example to keep it simple. Reading my own 
writing, I would probably have suggested what you did :-)

So here are the facts:
- client/server are not connected to the internet
- the network protocol is existing and proprietary
- the file structure is existing and proprietary, but can be extended to 
allow for additional signature information to be embedded that will be 
sent to the server
- the data actually transferred (and to be signed) is part of that file
- the data has to be signed with an X.509 certificates public key that 
already exists

S/MIME does pretty much do what I want to do. However the network 
protocol or the data to be signed cannot be changed for compatibility 
reasons. Under these circumstances, I don't really see how I could 
achieve my goal easier than by openssl directly.

Considering the &quot;very common requirement&quot;: I was thinking of i.e. 
windows driver signatures, android/ios app signatures and similar 
mechanisms to ensure that files are from a trusted source.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope some of you could give me advice on my project using openssl.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MW: Why are you using OpenSSL for this application? You want to create 
</I>&gt;<i> a file on a trusted system, pass it through an untrusted intermediary, 
</I>&gt;<i> and process it on another trusted system. Why not simply use an 
</I>&gt;<i> existing mechanism like secure email? (GPG is the obvious choice, 
</I>&gt;<i> unless there are licensing issues.) If you are determined to create 
</I>&gt;<i> your own protocol from primitives, then really all you appear to need 
</I>&gt;<i> here is an HMAC. Don't involve the horrific mess that is X.509 PKI 
</I>&gt;<i> unless it actually provides some benefit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lets say I have a server/service on a machine processing a file a 
</I>&gt;<i> corresponding client sends. That file is usually created by me on a 
</I>&gt;<i> clean third machine. The server side is assumed to be uncompromised 
</I>&gt;<i> (no hacker). The client side may be compromised. Now I need to make 
</I>&gt;<i> sure that the service only accepts those files that are created by me. 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that is a very common requirement and has been done alot of 
</I>&gt;<i> times - I just can't find tutorials on how to implement it. Know any ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MW: No, but that's probably because what you've described isn't &quot;a 
</I>&gt;<i> very common requirement&quot;. It's too vague. We don't know what problem 
</I>&gt;<i> you're actually trying to solve. It may be that you just need to send 
</I>&gt;<i> a file with a verifier, which - as I noted above - /is/ commonly done, 
</I>&gt;<i> generally using something like GPG or (for roll-your-own protocols 
</I>&gt;<i> where both ends are controlled by the same party) an HMAC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lets assume I have an x509 cert together with its private key signed 
</I>&gt;<i> by a ca owned by me. The trusted ca cert will be present on the server 
</I>&gt;<i> side. This is what I plan to do:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.) Create the data files/blobs and sign them using the priv key of 
</I>&gt;<i> the cert. Distribute the cert and the signature along with (or inside) 
</I>&gt;<i> the data file.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.) Have the client send that data file to the server (cert/sig first)
</I>&gt;<i> 3.) Service receives the cert, builds a cert store with the local ca 
</I>&gt;<i> cert in it and verifies the client's cert with X509_verify_cert()
</I>&gt;<i> 4.) if cert verifies ok, service compares the signature against the 
</I>&gt;<i> one calculated from the incoming data using the public key that came 
</I>&gt;<i> inside the cert just verified
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would this be the right approach considering that anything the client 
</I>&gt;<i> sends may be forged (cert, sig, data...) ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MW: It's safe from malicious behavior by the client, under a threat 
</I>&gt;<i> model where an attacker is not able to forge client certificates or 
</I>&gt;<i> client signatures. In other words, it's safe as long as the private 
</I>&gt;<i> keys are neither leaked nor forced.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or would it be safer to have the cert used for signing stored on the 
</I>&gt;<i> server side and not send with the data (instead just its subject 
</I>&gt;<i> protected by the signature) ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MW: Irrelevant to the security of the scheme. Simpler from a 
</I>&gt;<i> development and operations standpoint. But using something like 
</I>&gt;<i> PGP/GPG or S/MIME would be simpler yet. There are any number of 
</I>&gt;<i> examples online for signing a file and verifying its signature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks alot,
</I>&gt;<i> Marco
