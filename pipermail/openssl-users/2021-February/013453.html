<PRE>Hello Hubert (sorry, replied to your e-mail address directly before instead
of the mailing list),

thank you for your reply, but I don't think you're correct that timestamp
tokens expire together with the signing certificate! Timestamp tokens CAN
stay valid beyond the validity of the signing certificate, otherwise PAdES
LTV (Long Term Validity) wouldn't make much sense. Check RFC3161
specification chapter 4.1:

      When a TSA shall not be used anymore, but the TSA private key has
      not been compromised, the authority's certificate SHALL be
      revoked.  When the reasonCode extension relative to the revoked
      certificate from the TSA is present in the CRL entry extensions,
      it SHALL be set either to unspecified (0), affiliationChanged (3),
      superseded (4) or cessationOfOperation (5).  In that case, at any
      future time, the tokens signed with the corresponding key will be
      considered as invalid, but tokens generated before the revocation
      time will remain valid.  When the reasonCode extension relative to
      the revoked certificate from the TSA is not present in the CRL
      entry extensions, then all the tokens that have been signed with
      the corresponding key SHALL be considered as invalid.  For that
      reason, it is recommended to use the reasonCode extension.

Chapter 4.3 DOES talk about key lifetime and renewing trust in issued
tokens by restamping, however the term &quot;lifetime&quot; used here is in relation
to key-length (longer key-length = longer lifetime, finite key-length =
finite lifetime), NOT validity period of TSA certificate:

      The TSA signing key MUST be of a sufficient length to allow for a
      sufficiently long lifetime.  Even if this is done, the key will
      have a finite lifetime.  Thus, any token signed by the TSA SHOULD
      be time-stamped again (if authentic copies of old CRLs are
      available) or notarized (if they aren't) at a later date to renew
      the trust that exists in the TSA's signature. time-stamp tokens
      could also be kept with an Evidence Recording Authority to
      maintain this trust.

It doesn't make sense that a token could retain its validity beyond the
validity of the TSA certificate in a revocation scenario (when key or CA
hasn't been compromised) but not in an expiration scenario.
All TSA certificates I encountered so far have very short lifetimes (1-3
years). If it was true that tokens would only remain valid within that
period without being restamped, the whole point of PAdES LTV would be moot.

Cheers and thank you for your help,
Matthias
