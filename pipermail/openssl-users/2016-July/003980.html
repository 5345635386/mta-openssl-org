<PRE>Hi,

Although I did not post the PEM, I think I figured out why I was getting that error.  I had the &quot;keyUsage&quot; in the extensions, but I had to set criticality to true on that extension.  After that, I can open the cert in the Windows applet.

 Hi,
 
 I have a certificate that I issued using a set of openssl
 commands and when I use &quot;openssl x509&quot; and &quot;openssl verify&quot;
 to look at it and verify it, it is ok.
 
 Normally, when I take the certificate PEM with an extension
 of &quot;.crt&quot; or &quot;.cer&quot; in Windows, I can click on the file and
 the Windows certificate applet will open and I can view the
 cert.
 
 But, on this one cert, I get the popup with the error in the
 Subject line, and I'm trying to figure out why this is?
 
 I wanted to post the PEM to this list so someone might be
 able to review the cert, but I wanted to ask if that is
 permissible here?&#160; It would be just the PEM for the
 cert and it would be just a test cert.
 
 Thanks!
 
 Jim
