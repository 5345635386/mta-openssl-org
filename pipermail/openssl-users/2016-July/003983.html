<PRE>Thanks Matthew.

However the problem seems to be occurring before the processing of the return codes you mentioned.

The problem occurs from a bad return value from:
    if(SSL_connect(ssl) &lt;= 0)
        int_error(&quot;Error connecting SSL object&quot;);

A Wireshark trace reveals that the client shuts  down the handshake connection with the reason &#8216;Unknown CA&#8217;.

So if the client knows that the cert is self-signed as indicated by the debug logs, why would it issue the above reason for failure when it doesn&#8217;t need to know the CA?

Subject: [Newsletter] Re: [openssl-users] self-signed certificate won't work in my app but works with s_client

&quot;error 18:self signed certificate&quot; is the expected result if you are validating a self-signed cert.

In certificate verification, the code needs to check for X509_V_OK, X509_V_ERR_DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT and  X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY.

X509_V_OK is a normal cert verification and the connection can proceed.  X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY indicates that an otherwise valid cert has been processed, but the issuer is unknown.  X509_V_ERR_DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT indicates that a self-signed cert was read.  Any other return value is a fatal error (signature failure etc).

I am working with the example apps in the &quot;Networking Security with OpenSSL&quot; book and up until now have been able to get client/server examples 1,2,3 to work. But now I'm trying to connect to an in-house tool but I'm getting the error &quot;error 18:self signed certificate&quot;. Despite this error when I run my app (essentially client3), when I use s_client with the very same credentials...it works.

I suspect that it has something to do with the ssl/tls api combination that I use in my 'client3' app.

Here's the command and output for s_client that connects to the in-house tool which works:

    &gt; openssl s_client -connect 192.168.1.99:16001&lt;<A HREF="http://192.168.1.99:16001">http://192.168.1.99:16001</A>&gt; -CAfile ../_security/SipInspector/certificate.pem -key ../_security/client.pem
      Enter pass phrase for ../_security/client.pem:

Here's the command and output when I run my app that tries to connect to the same in-house tool which fails:

    &gt; ./client3 192.168.1.99
    Enter PEM pass phrase:
    connecting to 192.168.1.99:16001&lt;<A HREF="http://192.168.1.99:16001">http://192.168.1.99:16001</A>&gt;

    &gt;

Here are the api's I call in the my app that utilize the same credentials used by the s_client command:

 SSL_CTX_new(SSLv23_method());
 SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(ctx, &quot;../_security/SipInspector/certificate.pem&quot;, NULL)
 SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file(ctx, &quot;../_security/client.pem&quot;, SSL_FILETYPE_PEM)
 SSL_CTX_set_verify(ctx, SSL_VERIFY_PEER, verify_callback);
 SSL_CTX_set_verify_depth(ctx, 4);
 SSL_CTX_set_options(ctx, SSL_OP_ALL | SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2);

And also I used the openssl verify command to double check the certificate against itself (not sure if this really does anything).

Any help would be appreciated.
