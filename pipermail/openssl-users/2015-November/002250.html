On the server side, if at all possible, the selected protocol will be the highest one not disabled.

On the client side, it is more complicated, because the client can't propose a discrete list of protocols, rather it proposes a minimum and a maximum.

Therefore, with SSLv23_client_method() aka TLS_client_method() when you disable some set of protocols via:

    SSL_CTX_set_options(ctx, SSL_OP_NO_&lt;...&gt;)

lowest protocol that you *don't* disable becomes the minimum, and then the maximum is either one less than the first higher version that is disabled or else the maximum version supported.

Thus, for example, with;

    SSL_CTX_set_options(ctx, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2|SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1);

    The minimum is then SSL 3.0 and the maximum is TLS 1.0, thus
    this has the side-effect of disabling TLS 1.2 (and in the future
    also TLS 1.3).


&gt;<i> I've read that in general the client proposes the highest version it 
</I>&gt;<i> supports and the server chooses a compatible version or rejects if 
</I>&gt;<i> there isn't one.
</I>
The client proposes a range from lowest to highest.


&gt;<i> Rfc5246 basically says that the server will choose the highest version 
</I>&gt;<i> but I wanted to confirm that that's what openssl does (just to be 
</I>&gt;<i> certain).
</I>
OpenSSL may be unable to choose the highest version if none of the enabled ciphersuites are compatible with that version.  That should be rare, so in practice the server will choose the highest version proposed by the client and supported by the server.

&gt;<i> e.g.  if the client proposes TLSv1.2 and the server supports TLSv1.2, 
</I>&gt;<i> will the server *ever* select TLSv1.1? thanks.
</I>
It could, if none of the shared ciphersuites were compatible with TLS 1.2.  However, TLS 1.2 essentially supports a superset of the ciphersuites of TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 so this condition is unlikely.

The exception is EXPORT ciphersuites which were removed from TLS 1.2, but until quite recently was still willing to negotiate them even with TLS 1.2.  So if a client offers some EXPORT ciphers and the server is configured to use only EXPORT ciphers, I'm not sure whether these versions of OpenSSL will abort the handshake, or will choose a lower protocol version.
