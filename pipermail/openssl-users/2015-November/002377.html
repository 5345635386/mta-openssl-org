Isn't Blowfish a building block of bcrypt and/or some similar stuff? I 
think that implementations don't rely on OpenSSL but I wouldn't give it 
for granted.

As for the rest of the algorithms, a lot has been already said but I 
would like to share my personal opinion (that of someone who codes using 
the OpenSSL API since some time): I think of OpenSSL as an incredibly 
rich tool for the professionals and the students as well, if it were 
possible I would like to see all of the algorithms to be there forever, 
including the odd situation of people who must decrypt some content they 
produced a long time ago, for instance.
I understand that this is not feasable in the long-term, but we cannot 
forget that IT time is different from people time: the fact that an 
algorithm is born and becomes insecure in a few years doesn't mean that 
it won't be needed for some time, unless we accept the idea that OpenSSL 
is something to be used &quot;for the moment being&quot; (which is reasonable for 
SSL/TLS and communications in general, much less for file encryption and 
signature features).
So, if it were possible to keep the algorithms for a long time, 
providing a simple way to put them out of the compilation (and the 
default compilation options may just do that), that would be great. At 
least as long as they are API-compliant (of course, you cannot ask to be 
kept consistent with the rest of the code for decades).
My gratefulness to all developers, whatever it will be!
