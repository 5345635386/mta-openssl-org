<PRE>Hi OpenSSL Community,

I originally posted this message on the security area ML at IETF and I 
am trying to reach out to a broad audience of experts, implementers, and 
vendors. I would love to have contributions and implementations (once we 
have some initial specs) around this initiative. I am still trying to 
find the right host for the mailing list where to discuss all aspects of 
this initiative, but I hope that this message will spark some interest 
and (especially from one of the most vibrant crypto library community 
out there) possibly inspire the community to join the envisioned effort.

Any comments and feedback are welcome (positive and negative alike).

Cheers,
Max

Hi all,

I am not sure this is the right place to write this e-mail, but I hope
is. At the meeting I spoke with several people about an idea I had some
time ago but never landed at IETF. Since I got positive feedback and
suggestion to post the idea to this list to see if others might be
interested, here's the summary e-mail.

The idea is very simple: provide specifications for interfaces to
cryptographic libraries. The basic idea is to provide an API that
different vendors can implement on top of their libraries to provide a
standard interface for applications. If successful, an application could
make use of OpenSSL, MS-CAPI, Cryptlib, or any other crypto library that
provides that interface without having to re-write the crypto-related
code. This allows for portability (wider adoption of crypto-enabled
applications), code/modules re-usability, and the possibility for
applications to switch between vendors (e.g., switching to a better
crypto library or dismissing a library that has shown vulnerabilities).

Although I received positive feedback about the idea (I know, it has be
attempted in the past.. ), I was never able to get the green light to
proceed with a proposal for IETF (unfortunately the answer was always
&quot;we don't do APIs&quot; ... which, actually, it is not true), so I decided to
move forward anyway, since it is a real pain that needs to be solved. If
the IETF will like to pick up the work in the future, great. If not,
we'll solve the problem anyway :D

If you are interested in participating in the effort (e.g., writing
specs, participating in the discussion, provide feedback, or writing
code) please contact me and we'll take it from there. I wrote a couple
of pages today (very quick and dirty work for now.. so.. don't judge!),
but I hope we'll be able to gather momentum and work together on this.
The website is reachable at:

     <A HREF="http://cryptoapi.openca.org/">http://cryptoapi.openca.org/</A>

Last but not least - I am starting also another project that targets the
use of SYMMETRIC crypto by providing support for encryption at rest.
This library will provide support for storing encrypted data, signed
(hmac) data, symmetric keys, and symmetric keys bundles (stack of keys)
in such a way that it is simple to use (e.g., dealing with symmetric
crypto is hard for the average developer since not much support, outside
TLS, is provided). By defining a simple high-level API for symmetric
crypto we want to fill the gap and, hopefully, increase the use of
crypto also in those environment where asymmetric is not an option
(e.g., latency constraints). The idea is to actually write a standard
for symmetric crypto ... &quot;at rest&quot;.

Also for this project, please contact me directly (I still do not have
pages for this project for various reasons - most importantly I still
have to see if I get to open source what I did for my employer of if we
have to start from scratch) at this e-mail address.

Happy Security Everybody!

Cheers,
Max

P.S.: Other items on the back burner that I would welcome contributions
to are OCSP over DNS (ODIN), Lightweight Revocation Tokens (LIRT), the
PKI Resource Query Protocol (PRQP), Simplified CMC over HTTP, and the
Public Key (Discovery) System (PKS).
