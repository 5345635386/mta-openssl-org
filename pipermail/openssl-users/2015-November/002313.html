This is not a plausibly detailed explanation of how you're using
OpenSSL in your device.

&gt;<i> While validating the certificate chain from server, &quot;*check_trust&quot; *fails

</I>
OpenSSL 1.0.2 is broadly used, with no similar problem reports.
You're probably doing something atypical, and need to explain in
technical detail how you're configuring certificate verification.

&gt;<i> This had been working fine with OpenSSL 1.0.1c.
</I>
You can download <A HREF="http://openssl.org/source/old/1.0.2/openssl-1.0.2c.tar.gz">http://openssl.org/source/old/1.0.2/openssl-1.0.2c.tar.gz</A>
for yourself and check that the code you claim to make the difference
is simply not there.  If 1.0.2c is working and 1.0.2d is not, either
you're using a modified 1.0.2c (seek support from whoever made the
changes) or the problem lies elsewhere.

&gt;<i> When I checked the code execution, check_trust was not being called  in
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL 1.0.1c as &quot;if (param-&gt;trust &gt; 0)&quot; was not satisfied.
</I>
This is simply irrelevant, the change in question predates the
1.0.2 base version.

&gt;<i> That is why I wanted to know is it mandatory for the applications to
</I>&gt;<i> set X509_VERIFY_PARAM in X509_STORE_CTX
</I>
The question has a false premise and so makes no sense.  Rather
you need to forget about (param-&gt;trust) and focus on why your
application is failing to verify the peer certificate.
