<PRE>At most one of CA-1 and CA-2 would be part of the chain from Baltimore 
to the end cert.

However your end cert (apparently for hosted Sharepoint services) was 
issued by a 3rd MSIT CA that was not provided.  If it wasn't provided to 
the code either, the chain would not validate for that reason alone.

I also note that none of the certs in the chain contain any Authority 
Information Access (AIA) extension (issuer certificate download URL and 
OCSP URL) only a CRL URL extension, which wouldn't be normal MS practice 
(Certificate revocation cannot be detected by some browsers that use 
only OCSP and the automatic certificate download done by some Microsoft 
Windows Security Support Providers (such as CredSSP) won't work).

Oh and you are not posting from an official Microsoft e-mail address either.

Something seems very odd here.

</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Our device acts as TLS/SSL client.  The device receives chain of
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; certificates as part of SSL handshake, when it is trying to get
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; connected to TLS/SSL server like sharepoint 365.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; While validating the certificate chain from server, &quot;*check_trust&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; *fails with X509_V_ERR_CERT_UNTRUSTED.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; This had been working fine with OpenSSL 1.0.1c.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; When I checked the code execution, check_trust was not being
</I>&gt;<i>     called  in
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; OpenSSL 1.0.1c as &quot;if (param-&gt;trust &gt; 0)&quot; was not satisfied.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; That is why I wanted to know is it mandatory for the applications to
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; set X509_VERIFY_PARAM in X509_STORE_CTX
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Are you able to share the certificates that the server provides you
</I>&gt;<i>     with? Also the root certificate you are using.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     It is not mandatory to set X509_VERIFY_PARAMs (but typically you at
</I>&gt;<i>     least want to verify the hostname through a call to
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host&quot;). Are you currently do anything like
</I>&gt;<i>     this?
