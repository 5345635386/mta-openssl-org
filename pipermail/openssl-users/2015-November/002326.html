We can significantly reduce that liability by removing any assembler
optimisations. Also just because something is available doesn't mean it
has to be &quot;default&quot;. We can have good defaults whilst keeping old crypto.

</I>&gt;<i> be in default compiled code size.
</I>
Disabling algorithms isn't the right answer IMO. I do like the idea of a
&quot;liblegacycrypto&quot;. That way people that only have need of current
up-to-date crypto can stick with the main library. Others who need the
older crypto can still get at it. Yes, that means we still have to
maintain this code - but I don't see it as that big a burden.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> do that's long overdue.
</I>
Being the &quot;swiss army knife&quot; is no bad thing (even where that includes
old crypto). We just have to find a way to separate the two concerns:
current crypto (and only current crypto) for most (and probably most
importantly for libssl users); broader crypto support for those that
want it (which is why I like the liblegacycrypto idea because it enables
us to do that).


&gt;<i> It seems to me that these can pretty safely go:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> MD2 - (The argument that someone somewhere may want to keep verifying
</I>&gt;<i> old MD2 signatures on self-signed certs doesn't seem like a compelling
</I>&gt;<i> enough reason to me. It's been disabled by default since OpenSSL 1.0.0.)
</I>&gt;<i> MDC2
</I>&gt;<i> SEED
</I>&gt;<i> RC5 
</I>
All candidates for liblegacycrypto IMO rather than deletion.

Whether this is the right thing to do in the 1.1.0 timeframe is another
consideration though. Viktor's arguments are quite convincing.
