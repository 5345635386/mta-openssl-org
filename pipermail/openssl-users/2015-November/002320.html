</I>&gt;<i> I asked for mainstream use-cases for algorithms whose removal could 
</I>&gt;<i> cause widespread pain. Some individual users, undoubtedly, will be hit 
</I>&gt;<i> by this, and I acknowledge that they may not be reading this list. But 
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to know if I'd missed something endemic. I also asked 
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere: Adam Langley pointed me to the MD4 use-case and Steve 
</I>&gt;<i> confirmed that RC2 must stay.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a tradeoff: by attempting to accommodate every single 
</I>&gt;<i> use-case, we will weaken the library for a substantial amount of our 
</I>&gt;<i> user base, by offering them bad defaults, or simply by virtue of the 
</I>&gt;<i> fact that our developer resources are not infinite. (Near)-dead code 
</I>&gt;<i> is a liability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So far, excluding suspicions that something may be used somewhere, 
</I>&gt;<i> I've received one clear argument, for RC5. And, while I'm sympathetic 
</I>&gt;<i> to the cause, I believe this is the case where we have to balance one 
</I>&gt;<i> user's needs against everyone else's.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for specific deprecation strategies:
</I>&gt;<i> - Don't forget that all applications will have to recompile against 1.1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Disabling algorithms doesn't work well for us as it's just pushing 
</I>&gt;<i> the decision on the distros. It also wouldn't win us any resources as 
</I>&gt;<i> we'd still be responsible for keeping the code bug-free. The only win 
</I>&gt;<i> would be in default compiled code size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - We can leave OPENSSL_NO_XXX defines around so wrapper libraries 
</I>&gt;<i> (Python, PHP etc) who correctly account for the fact that an 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation may be missing (which they have to, anyway) will 
</I>&gt;<i> continue to work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Removing assembly support is a GREAT suggestion to simplify the 
</I>&gt;<i> complexity, and I think we should do this for anything we end up 
</I>&gt;<i> leaving in, and perhaps even for some things not yet on the hit list 
</I>&gt;<i> (RC4?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - I appreciate OpenSSL's role as a &quot;Swiss army knife&quot; research tool 
</I>&gt;<i> but research needs shouldn't prevail over those of real applications. 
</I>&gt;<i> We are generally not on the frontline of deprecating things - RC4 
</I>&gt;<i> isn't yet on the list. SSLv3 isn't yet on the list, etc. But we can't 
</I>&gt;<i> become the Internet Archive of All Old Crypto either, and there's some 
</I>&gt;<i> cleanup to do that's long overdue.
</I>There is also the point that OpenSSL is the worlds most well known 
&quot;Swiss army knife&quot; crypto package for non-research uses.  The more you 
overfocus on the single SSL/TLS use case, the less attractive OpenSSL 
becomes to all other uses.  If OpenSSL makes itself useless, others will 
have to reinvent it.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - I believe that the OpenSSL community generally tends to overlook the 
</I>&gt;<i> positive impact of change when trying to round up the negative impact 
</I>&gt;<i> of breakage. Applications are generally able to move along and fix 
</I>&gt;<i> things when presented with the right incentives. Applications that 
</I>&gt;<i> aren't generally able to move along are rather unlikely to jump onto 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL 1.1, and all these algorithms will be supported as part of 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL 1.0.2 until 2020 for them. Finally, removing support for these 
</I>&gt;<i> algorithms from OpenSSL doesn't render your encrypted storage 
</I>&gt;<i> inaccessible. You can always use another implementation to 
</I>&gt;<i> decrypt/re-encrypt your data, and I fully believe in the power of the 
</I>&gt;<i> community in providing such tools where necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Recent anecdotal evidence: OpenSSL's Logjam protection caused pretty 
</I>&gt;<i> widespread MySQL breakage. That made MySQL backport a change 
</I>&gt;<i> increasing the DH key length from 512 to 2048 bits. For end user 
</I>&gt;<i> security, it's a win. I would prefer that we start cashing in these 
</I>&gt;<i> improvements before the next Logjam happens. (This is my view; as you 
</I>&gt;<i> can see views differ even within the team.)
</I>The Logjam protection was an SSL-only change.  It has NO relevance to 
the deleterious effects of crippling the non-SSL functionality in the 
OpenSSL libraries.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - On binary elliptic curves: with recent cryptographic advances, I 
</I>&gt;<i> believe these are now firmly planted in the &quot;internet archive&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> category, even if not practically broken yet. The other reason for 
</I>&gt;<i> removing these is that our implementations are crappy. They're not 
</I>&gt;<i> constant-time, and they've been shown to contain bugs. Improving upon 
</I>&gt;<i> these implementations is not a good use of dev time imo, given their 
</I>&gt;<i> decreasing credibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the list of algorithms gone from BoringSSL:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IDEA, MD2, MDC2, RC5, RIPEMD, SEED, Whirlpool, binary curves
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This isn't of course entirely representative of widespread usage. 
</I>&gt;<i> However Google's multi-billion line codebase now builds against 
</I>&gt;<i> BoringSSL and therefore largely does not depend on these algorithms. 
</I>&gt;<i> Those billions of lines aren't all new and shiny code written in 2015, 
</I>&gt;<i> and some of it does have to interoperate with the outside world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And here's the list gone from LibreSSL, from what I can tell:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MD2, MDC2, RC5, SEED
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Neither have removed CAST, and there is presumably a good reason for 
</I>&gt;<i> that. (PGP?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that these can pretty safely go:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MD2 - (The argument that someone somewhere may want to keep verifying 
</I>&gt;<i> old MD2 signatures on self-signed certs doesn't seem like a compelling 
</I>&gt;<i> enough reason to me. It's been disabled by default since OpenSSL 1.0.0.)
</I>Please read my description again.  I was arguing that the disabling of 
signature checking done in OpenSSL 1.0.0 was a mistake and is really a 
security-weakening bug.  As that bug is fixed (by reinstating, in 
general, the checking of the self-signature on root certificates), the 
problem with MD2 being disabled completely (rather than being marked as 
untrusted) will resurface, at least for data at rest (prime *example* is 
CMS signed e-mail and files signed with certificates that trace back to 
the original Verisign root).
&gt;<i> MDC2
</I>&gt;<i> SEED
</I>&gt;<i> RC5
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These could probably stay (C only):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CAST
</I>&gt;<i> IDEA
</I>&gt;<i> RIPEMD (used in Bitcoin?)
</I>&gt;<i> WHIRLPOOL
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> as well as
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BLOWFISH
</I>&gt;<i> MD4
</I>&gt;<i> RC2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am on the fence about the binary curves: I am not aware of any 
</I>&gt;<i> usage, really, and it's not about to pick up now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Emilia

</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; We are considering removing from OpenSSL 1.1 known broken or
</I>&gt;<i>     outdated
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; cryptographic primitives. As you may know the forks have already
</I>&gt;<i>     done
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; this but I'd like to seek careful feedback for OpenSSL first to
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; ensure we won't be breaking any major applications.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; These algorithms are currently candidates for removal:
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; CAST
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; IDEA
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; MDC2
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; MD2 [ already disabled by default ]
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; RC5 [ already disabled by default ]
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; RIPEMD
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; SEED
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; WHIRLPOOL
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; ALL BINARY ELLIPTIC CURVES
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; My preference would be to remove these algorithms completely (as in,
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; delete the code). Disabled-by-default code will either be re-enabled
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; by distros (if there's widespread need for it - in which case we
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; might as well leave it in) or will be poorly tested and is likely to
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; just silently rot and break. This code is bloat and maintentance
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; burden for us - my hope is that much of this code is effectively
</I>&gt;<i>     dead
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; and can be removed.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; *Are you aware of any mainstream need to continue supporting these
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; algorithms in OpenSSL 1.1?* Note that an older OpenSSL library or
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; binary, or a standalone implementation or another crypto toolkit can
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; always be used to continue supporting a legacy standalone
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; application, or to decrypt ciphertext from the distant past. I am
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; looking for use cases that could cause e.g. interop breakage between
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; new and old peers, or major pain to distro end-users.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; These algorithms are obsolete but removing them doesn't look
</I>&gt;<i>     feasible:
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; BLOWFISH - probably still in use though I don't know where exactly?
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; MD4 - used in NTLM
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; RC2 - used in PKCS#12
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; *Did I miss anything from the list?*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I'd say that this is the wrong approach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     If you have old stuff signed with MD2, and then timestamped with MD5,
</I>&gt;<i>     SHA-1, SHA-256 over the years, with new timestamp added every year
</I>&gt;<i>     this
</I>&gt;<i>     makes the MD2 signature _valid_ and _secure_.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     If you have stuff that is encrypted, but in deep storage with any of
</I>&gt;<i>     those algorithms, then yes, it's less than optimal. Removing
</I>&gt;<i>     support for
</I>&gt;<i>     those algorithm will make this data inaccessible. Not to mention that
</I>&gt;<i>     stuff like IDEA or SEED may never get broken before the data in them
</I>&gt;<i>     needs to remain secret - and after that creating a new archive with
</I>&gt;<i>     unencrypted data after it can become public would simply cost money.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     And as some pointed out, few OpenSSL users actually read mailing
</I>&gt;<i>     lists,
</I>&gt;<i>     fewer still know what actual primitives are necessary for their
</I>&gt;<i>     stuff to
</I>&gt;<i>     work (e.g. PKCS#8 files specify inside them the cipher and key
</I>&gt;<i>     derivation necessary for decryption).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     What I think is the correct course of action, is to have in the
</I>&gt;<i>     configuration file settings which specify the set of algorithms
</I>&gt;<i>     that are
</I>&gt;<i>     set as available and trusted. So that we can disable them by
</I>&gt;<i>     default and
</I>&gt;<i>     require the users to make a concious decision to enable support for
</I>&gt;<i>     them. (Make openssl print to stderr info about them being
</I>&gt;<i>     administratively disabled when application tries using them for bonus
</I>&gt;<i>     points).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     This allows to place the information about this depreciation in a
</I>&gt;<i>     place
</I>&gt;<i>     where users will actually see it and will make them concious of using
</I>&gt;<i>     weak and badly tested algorithms. At the same time it will protect
</I>&gt;<i>     most
</I>&gt;<i>     of the users that don't require such obsolete algorithms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     But this concious decision MUST NOT require recompilation of the
</I>&gt;<i>     package. Few if any distributions support recompiled packages. For
</I>&gt;<i>     many
</I>&gt;<i>     end-users this is also a hurdle they simply can't cross.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     And this also allows openssl to change the cryptographic policy in
</I>&gt;<i>     stable branches without breaking the API/ABI promise. (POODLE, FREAK,
</I>&gt;<i>     Logjam)
</I>&gt;<i>
