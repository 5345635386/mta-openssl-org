The EVP_get_cipherbyname() and EVP_get_digestbyname() interfaces
remain, so nothing changes at compile-time.  Most code does not
use EVP_&lt;algorithm-name&gt;() directly.  This means that:

    * Most errors are not caught at compile time.

    * Porting is not the difficult part, the much more difficult
      problem is dealing with runtime access to any algorithms needed
      to handle data at rest.

&gt;<i> - Disabling algorithms doesn't work well for us as it's just pushing the
</I>&gt;<i> decision on the distros. It also wouldn't win us any resources as we'd
</I>&gt;<i> still be responsible for keeping the code bug-free. The only win would be
</I>&gt;<i> in default compiled code size.
</I>
Removing assembly support would substantially lower support cost.
For many of the algorithms we can likely find a reference implementation
in an RFC or similar standards document, if our own code is
substantially more refined (and requires greater support effort).

&gt;<i> - We can leave OPENSSL_NO_XXX defines around so wrapper libraries (Python,
</I>&gt;<i> PHP etc) who correctly account for the fact that an implementation may be
</I>&gt;<i> missing (which they have to, anyway) will continue to work.
</I>
These don't help with EVP &quot;by name&quot; indirection.

&gt;<i> - Removing assembly support is a GREAT suggestion to simplify the
</I>&gt;<i> complexity, and I think we should do this for anything we end up leaving
</I>&gt;<i> in, and perhaps even for some things not yet on the hit list (RC4?).
</I>
Yes, and probably.

&gt;<i> - I appreciate OpenSSL's role as a &quot;Swiss army knife&quot; research tool but
</I>&gt;<i> research needs shouldn't prevail over those of real applications. We are
</I>&gt;<i> generally not on the frontline of deprecating things - RC4 isn't yet on the
</I>&gt;<i> list. SSLv3 isn't yet on the list, etc. But we can't become the Internet
</I>&gt;<i> Archive of All Old Crypto either, and there's some cleanup to do that's
</I>&gt;<i> long overdue.
</I>
Researchers can indeed use older toolkits, my concern is real users,
with non-SSL applications (data at rest).

&gt;<i> - Recent anecdotal evidence: OpenSSL's Logjam protection caused pretty
</I>&gt;<i> widespread MySQL breakage. That made MySQL backport a change increasing the
</I>&gt;<i> DH key length from 512 to 2048 bits. For end user security, it's a win. I
</I>&gt;<i> would prefer that we start cashing in these improvements before the next
</I>&gt;<i> Logjam happens. (This is my view; as you can see views differ even within
</I>&gt;<i> the team.)
</I>
This is SSL/TLS where we have algorithm agility.  I support the
Logjam changes.  It is likely time for us to take the next (not
final) step from 768 to 1024 as the min prime size.

&gt;<i> - On binary elliptic curves: with recent cryptographic advances, I believe
</I>&gt;<i> these are now firmly planted in the &quot;internet archive&quot; category, even if
</I>&gt;<i> not practically broken yet. The other reason for removing these is that our
</I>&gt;<i> implementations are crappy. They're not constant-time, and they've been
</I>&gt;<i> shown to contain bugs. Improving upon these implementations is not a good
</I>&gt;<i> use of dev time imo, given their decreasing credibility.
</I>
I agree they need to go from SSL/TLS.  What about S/MIME and CMS?

&gt;<i> Here's the list of algorithms gone from BoringSSL:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IDEA, MD2, MDC2, RC5, RIPEMD, SEED, Whirlpool, binary curves
</I>
Boring SSL has a very narrow user base.  By all means drop
as much as you can get away with.

&gt;<i> And here's the list gone from LibreSSL, from what I can tell:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> MD2, MDC2, RC5, SEED
</I>
Likewise, not a wide user base.  We can make incremental steps,
drop assembly support and SSL/TLS codepoints in this release, and
assess things from there.  My hope is that the support cost of a
stable reference implementation in C (yes, likely not constant
time) is not that onerous.
