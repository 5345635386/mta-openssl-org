</I>because this the request contains only contain the certificate serial 
number and not the certificate at all;
what would you know, when sniffing a request of validating a certificate 
with serial 575775757
from CA x?
in case you have a database, where you could lookup the serial in 
connection with the CA x,
then you have some information that raise some little privacy concerns, 
but without ...

having tracking pixels, strange scripts raise bigger problems: in 
security and privacy ...

&gt;<i> But if so, I fail to see why the
</I>&gt;<i> existence of some certificates where the amount of information an
</I>&gt;<i> attacker could gain is smaller (but not nil) means that we should not
</I>&gt;<i> deploy OCSP over https for *all* certificates?
</I>of course, when deploying OCSP over TLS, this must be done for ALL 
certificates; but relaying
on OCSP Stapling which itself is a security hole, is the wrong way;
(I mentioned this problem earlier)
when validating if it is save to connect to a host,
the information must come from third party and not from the host itself 
(as OCSP Stapling is done)
&gt;<i> I also very much hope that CAs will deploy CT for S/MIME too.
</I>only in hospitals ;-)

always think of this:
not the defect head light caused the accident, where the car slipped of 
the road ;-)

in other words, always think of the real cause before;
OCSP and CRL downloads are not the cause for privacy concerns, so there 
is no need of changing this;

Greetings,
Walter
