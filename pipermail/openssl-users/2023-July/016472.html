Hi Paul,

Yes it does do an integrity check on load.  This was the main reason to
limit the FIPS provider to being a loadable module.  The approach taken in
the 1.0.2 FOM wasn't viable with the re-architecture.

 I assume these checks will be done even if we programmatically load fips.
 Do we have similar checks for legacy provider as well (to make sure
legacy.so/legacy.dll loaded is the right one and not something tampered by
some body)?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) can both legacy and fips providers be loaded and used?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Technically yes, but you'll not be FIPS compliant unless you are
</I>&gt;<i> *extremely* careful.
</I>&gt;<i> Which means talking to your FIPS labs and getting official resolutions on
</I>&gt;<i> the specifics.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Is it possible If i have built openssl with no-module configure option
</I>&gt;<i> (to statically link legacy provider) and also wanted to use  openssl-3.0.8
</I>&gt;<i> built fips module here? If yes then in what way can it be done?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Honestly not sure here.  You *must* load the FIPS provider dynamically to
</I>&gt;<i> be compliant.
</I>&gt;<i> If that's possible with the no-module option, you should be okay.  I
</I>&gt;<i> suspect it isn't.  Try it and see.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Is it possible to load multiple providers like default, leacy and also
</I>&gt;<i> fips programmatically using  OSSL_PROVIDER_load function ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Absolutely it is possible.  However, meeting FIPS requirements afterwards
</I>&gt;<i> could be problematic.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6) When multiple providers like for ex:  FIPS and default provider are
</I>&gt;<i> enabled and when an encryption function is called, then algorithm from
</I>&gt;<i> which provider is picked(from my findings it can use any of the loaded
</I>&gt;<i> provider implementations )? assumption that we have *not* used property
</I>&gt;<i> query string during algorithm fetches to specify which implementation to be
</I>&gt;<i> used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The OpenSSL project *deliberately* makes *no guarantee* about which
</I>&gt;<i> provider is used in such cases.  It is deterministic currently, but there
</I>&gt;<i> is no guarantee that we'll not change the order of resolution or making it
</I>&gt;<i> randomly non-deterministic in any future releases.  Honestly, expect that *we
</I>&gt;<i> will* make changes to the resolution order in the future.  Such a change
</I>&gt;<i> is not considered breaking and doesn't have to adhere to our stable release
</I>&gt;<i> policy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our best recommendation is to not mix providers in library contexts.  Seek
</I>&gt;<i> resolution from you FIPS lab.
