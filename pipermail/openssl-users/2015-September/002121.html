Publishing by someone else is fine, go for it. It would be nice to have
someone else publish FIPS module code, or validation information of any
kind for that matter. I think the validation process would be a lot less
capricious with less of the secrecy that is the current norm.

Anything we (OpenSSL) publish carries with it an implied support
obligation, and that's the key problem with FIPS specific code: it can't
be &quot;verified&quot; in any meaningful sense other than with an official formal
FIPS 140-2 validation. The FIPS 140-2 requirements are more metaphysical
and ideological than technical, and what's worse those requirements are
applied very subjectively. By that I mean that on multiple occasions
I've had the experience of taking very similar or even precisely
identical code through parallel validations, with different end results.

The presence of FIPS specific code in an OpenSSL repo would imply some
sort of suitability for use with FIPS validations. No matter how many
disclaimers and caveats we attached to that, there would still be
vendors trying to use it to obtain validations and encountering
problems. Guess who they're gonna call?

That problem is avoided if we obtain an open source based validation --
one where the module is distributed in source code form -- that has been
successfully validated. That validation then speaks for itself.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting, I wonder if those plans include my previously

</I>
There are some issues with those ideas, but now is not the time to get
into details. We'll worry about it if and when we have an opportunity to
do a new open source based validation.
