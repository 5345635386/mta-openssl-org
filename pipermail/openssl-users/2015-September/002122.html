Point is that the contribution agreement contains a bug, whereby
anything not published by the OpenSSL Foundation in the UK is not
licensed to anyone.

Having a publication procedure for things marked &quot;This does NOT
work in its current form, but we are giving you a license&quot; works
around that bug to the benefit of anyone recovering the project
similar to how the original Australian project (SSLeay) was
recovered by Dr. Henson in the UK as OpenSSL.


&gt;<i> Anything we (OpenSSL) publish carries with it an implied support
</I>&gt;<i> obligation, and that's the key problem with FIPS specific code: it can't
</I>&gt;<i> be &quot;verified&quot; in any meaningful sense other than with an official formal
</I>&gt;<i> FIPS 140-2 validation. The FIPS 140-2 requirements are more metaphysical
</I>&gt;<i> and ideological than technical, and what's worse those requirements are
</I>&gt;<i> applied very subjectively. By that I mean that on multiple occasions
</I>&gt;<i> I've had the experience of taking very similar or even precisely
</I>&gt;<i> identical code through parallel validations, with different end results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The presence of FIPS specific code in an OpenSSL repo would imply some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of suitability for use with FIPS validations. No matter how many
</I>&gt;<i> disclaimers and caveats we attached to that, there would still be
</I>&gt;<i> vendors trying to use it to obtain validations and encountering
</I>&gt;<i> problems. Guess who they're gonna call?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That problem is avoided if we obtain an open source based validation --
</I>&gt;<i> one where the module is distributed in source code form -- that has been
</I>&gt;<i> successfully validated. That validation then speaks for itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We also have plans for a significant rewrite of the FIPS module
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from its current form, and it's unlikely any third party submissions
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would fit that vision.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Interesting, I wonder if those plans include my previously
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> posted ideas:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> There are some issues with those ideas, but now is not the time to get
</I>&gt;<i> into details. We'll worry about it if and when we have an opportunity to
</I>&gt;<i> do a new open source based validation.
</I>Agreed, just making sure they were posted somewhere you
could find them when the time comes.


Enjoy
