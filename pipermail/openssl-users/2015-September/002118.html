<PRE>Dear Steve,

Have you considered that their contribution may be of value
to the next/future major version of the open source FIPS
module (which would presumably involve a fresh submission
under updated FIPS validation rules).

This would obviously be a different code branch from
maintenance/change letter updates to the current module.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We can certainly submit a pull request on the master branch.  It'll take
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a little time to prepare that.  IMHO, there is value in accepting this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pull request on the FIPS branch as well.  There are OpenSSL users doing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> private label FIPS validations that would benefit.
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, value for the very small number of vendors with pockets deep
</I>&gt;<i> enough to pursue their own proprietary validations that will benefit no
</I>&gt;<i> one else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're an open source organization with limited resources. We want to
</I>&gt;<i> apply those resources effectively to benefit the greater community. Even
</I>&gt;<i> though FIPS 140-2 is of significant interest to only part of the U.S.
</I>&gt;<i> market, and of minimal interest to the rest of the world, the open
</I>&gt;<i> source based validations see enough use[*] to justify the significant
</I>&gt;<i> effort those consume. We can't justify that impact for a handful of U.S.
</I>&gt;<i> vendors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then there is the issue of code &quot;ownership&quot;. We have dropped code for
</I>&gt;<i> platforms we can't access and test ourselves. The real &quot;test&quot; for FIPS
</I>&gt;<i> related code is whether the validation bureaucracy will approve it, and
</I>&gt;<i> we know from long experience that we can't assume said approval; the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;interop&quot; test is a validation certificate. If we accept outside
</I>&gt;<i> contributions of FIPS related code we'll have no way of knowing if that
</I>&gt;<i> code will actually satisfy any particular attempt at validation. Your
</I>&gt;<i> response to that will be that you'll only give us code that *you* have
</I>&gt;<i> successfully validated, in a module that only you can use, but again we
</I>&gt;<i> know from long experience that the exact same module can be submitted
</I>&gt;<i> multiple times with very different results. Your successful private
</I>&gt;<i> closed source validation is of minimal use to anyone else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An open source based validation, that everyone can use either directly
</I>&gt;<i> or as the basis for copycat &quot;private label&quot; validations, is the correct
</I>&gt;<i> answer. I see no benefit to us or the vast majority of our user base in
</I>&gt;<i> committing speculative code that we can't verify and that most of our
</I>&gt;<i> users can't use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pull request 368
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contains the FIPS vector processing utility for KDF.  None of the FIPS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vector processing utilities reside in master.  The pull request we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prepare for master isn't going to include the KDF vector processing utility.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please let me know whether we should proceed with preparing a pull
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> request on master.
</I>&gt;<i> If it doesn't have any FIPS dependencies and is useful for the overall
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL community outside of any FIPS context, sure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Steve M.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [*] Many hundreds of vendors, most but not all small companies you never
</I>&gt;<i> heard of. Those are the ones who use the #1747 validation directly,
</I>&gt;<i> still more do copycat validations.
</I>&gt;<i>

Enjoy
