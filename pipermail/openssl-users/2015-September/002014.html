<PRE>1. I trust that functions to allocate specific data 
&#160; types (such as bignums) are not changed by this.
	They are not.

2. Macros that take zero arguments (such as 
&#160; &quot;OPENSSL_malloc_init()&quot;) are not accepted by all 
&#160; compilers.&#160; In my own API designs this has forced 
&#160; me to give such macros a dummy argument (which is 
&#160; never used, it just pleases the preprocessor).
	Luckily, we are limiting to c89, so this isn't an issue.

3. When compiling without compile-time debug flags, 
&#160; the various debug arguments should not be passed 
&#160; (or otherwise referenced) by the macros, avoiding 
&#160; a bunch of &quot;foo.c&quot; and line number values from 
&#160; filling up the compiled binary.&#160; Something like
	This is a good idea.  In fact, I'll make all the memory-debug stuff disabled via the #ifdef.

4. For the basic functions (not the callbacks), there 
&#160; seems to be no reason not to change to size_t now.
	Agreed.  It will happen in 1.1, just not the planned commit.

5. Given the huge number of backward incompatibilities 
&#160; in OpenSSL 1.1.x, this seems a good time to change to 
&#160; size_t in the callbacks too.
	Yup, same reason.

6. Maybe there should be an alternate get/set_mem_functions 
&#160; with non-linenumber callbacks (behind the scenes, either 
&#160; would set the the other callbacks to stubs that add/remove 
&#160; the extra args, the initial defaults would be direct for 
&#160; speed and to support the &quot;defer to default implementation&quot; 
&#160; scenarios).
	If you look, that's what the current (undocumented) code does.  It was really hard to understand.  I think being able to replace malloc/realloc/free at runtime, as opposed to editing the source and building your own version, is the wrong trade-off to make.  But that's the goal of this thread:  to find out if anyone is actually doing that.

7. Maybe the get/set_mem_functions should (in their debug 
&#160; variant) should also be able to change the backend for 
&#160; debug_push/_pop.
	Same as #6.

8. For readability, defines with omitted (opaque) 
&#160; definitions should be documented with elided args such 
&#160; as #define OPENSSL_malloc(num) ... and 
&#160; #define CRYPTO_MEM_CHECK_ON 0x... to indicate that they 
&#160; do not (typically) expand to nothing/typically do expand 
&#160; to a numeric constant
	That seems reasonable; anyone else agree?

9. Typo: &quot;pointers for with the current functions&quot;
	Thanks!

10. It would be helpful to clarify which older functions are 
&#160; getting removed.&#160; It's a bit like reading a patch without 
&#160; the removed lines.&#160; Kind of impossible to tell what you 
&#160; propose to remove.
	Here's the internal git commit message.  Do you need/want more detail?
    Make the &quot;change wrapper functions&quot; be the only paradigm.
    Wrote documentation!
    Format the 'set func' functions so their paramlists are readible
    Format some multi-line comments.
    Remove LEVITTE_DEBUG_MEM
    Remove ability to get/set the &quot;set options&quot; functions at runtime.
    Remove ability to get/set the &quot;memory debug&quot; functions at runtme.
    Remove CRYPTO_pop_all
    Remove MemCheck_* and CRYPTO_malloc_debug_init macros
    Remove memleak_callback stuff.
    Remove {OPENSSL,CRYPTO}_remalloc.
    Remove {OPENSSL,CRYPTO}_strdup; use BUF_strdup.
    Add CRYPTO_mem_debug(int flag) function.
    Add test/memleaktest.
    Rename CRYPTO_dbg_xxx to CRYPTO_mem_debug_xxx
    Rename CRYPTO_{push,pop}_info to CRYPTO_mem_debug_{push,pop}
    Rename CRYPTO_malloc_init to OPENSSL_malloc_init; remove needless calls.
    Rename *_realloc_clear to *_clear_realloc, like *_clear_free
    Only two macros CRYPTO_MDEBUG,CRYPTO_MDEBUG_ABORT to control this.
