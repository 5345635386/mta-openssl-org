Well to have a chance of answering that I need to understand why your
application is behaving in the way I described below. If your
application is doing something weird and unexpected it may well be that
it just happened to work by accident in 1.0.1m, but something under the
hood changed, and it doesn't any more.

Why do we see this strange double handshake in your application where
the client/server apparently switch roles? Is there something about your
application design that could explain it? Is it intentional?

Matt

</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; The test scenario is that we are trying to connect a cisco based
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Endpoint device to a Video conference server, where our code resides.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Please help us with this DTLS failure scenario which we are not able to

</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Openssl APIs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     This looks like quite a strange trace in both the success and
</I>&gt;<i>     failure cases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The traces are slightly confusing because it looks like you are making
</I>&gt;<i>     multiple connections from different ports. To simplify things in the
</I>&gt;<i>     success case I filtered wireshark to only show me the port 22602 &lt;-&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     port 49164 communication.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     This showed me the following interaction
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Client                     Server
</I>&gt;<i>     ======                     ======
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     ClientHello
</I>&gt;<i>                                ServerHello
</I>&gt;<i>                                Certificate
</I>&gt;<i>                                ServerHelloDone
</I>&gt;<i>     ClientKeyExchange
</I>&gt;<i>     ChangeCipherSpec
</I>&gt;<i>     EncryptedHandshakeMessage
</I>&gt;<i>                                ChangeCipherSpec
</I>&gt;<i>                                EncryptedHandshakeMessage
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     So far so good. This looks like a normal successful handshake. The
</I>&gt;<i>     EncryptedHandshakeMessages at the end of these exchanges are the
</I>&gt;<i>     Finished messages indicating that the handshake was successful. I would
</I>&gt;<i>     then expect to see Application Data being exchanged. Instead I see this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Client                     Server
</I>&gt;<i>     ======                     ======
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                                ClientHello
</I>&gt;<i>     ServerHello
</I>&gt;<i>     Certificate
</I>&gt;<i>     ServerKeyExchange
</I>&gt;<i>     CertificateRequest
</I>&gt;<i>     ServerHelloDone
</I>&gt;<i>                                Certificate
</I>&gt;<i>                                ClientKeyExchange
</I>&gt;<i>                                CertificateVerify
</I>&gt;<i>                                ChangeCipherSpec
</I>&gt;<i>                                EncryptedHandshakeMessage
</I>&gt;<i>     ChangeCipherSpec
</I>&gt;<i>     EncryptedHandshakeMessage
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     So AFAICT the client and server appear to have swapped roles!!! The
</I>&gt;<i>     server is sending Client message and the client is sending server
</I>&gt;<i>     messages. Not only that but the connection previously established seems
</I>&gt;<i>     to have been thrown away and they are starting from scratch (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i>     unencrypted) without having first shutdown the previous connection or
</I>&gt;<i>     having sent any application data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The failure case is similar. The client and server apparently
</I>&gt;<i>     successfully complete a handshake. They then seem to swap roles
</I>&gt;<i>     (starting from scratch again, without any app data being sent), except
</I>&gt;<i>     this time we see:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Client                     Server
</I>&gt;<i>     ======                     ======
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                                ClientHello
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     ServerHello
</I>&gt;<i>     Certificate
</I>&gt;<i>     ServerKeyExchange
</I>&gt;<i>     CertificateRequest
</I>&gt;<i>     ServerHelloDone
</I>&gt;<i>                                Alert (Handshake Failure)
</I>&gt;<i>                                ClientHello
</I>&gt;<i>     ServerHello
</I>&gt;<i>     Certificate
</I>&gt;<i>     ServerKeyExchange
</I>&gt;<i>     CertificateRequest
</I>&gt;<i>     ServerHelloDone
</I>&gt;<i>                                Alert (Decrypt Error)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     So here we see the &quot;server&quot;, that seems to have forgotten it is the
</I>&gt;<i>     server and is now acting as the client attempt to initiate a handshake
</I>&gt;<i>     (forgetting all about the previous connection). It then fails with a
</I>&gt;<i>     Handshake Failure (I'm not surprised), and apparently decides to have
</I>&gt;<i>     another go. This time we see a DecryptError which suggests the &quot;server&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     (acting as a client) is expecting to receive encrypted data, but the
</I>&gt;<i>     client (acting as a server) is still sending unencrypted data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     You need to try and figure out why the two ends of the communication are
</I>&gt;<i>     so confused about what role they are playing (or is there something you
</I>&gt;<i>     haven't told me about the way your application works?).
