<PRE>Hi Steve,
What you've described sounds exactly like what I want to do. Couple of
questions/concerns in regards to what you've just stated:

1) Is there a way to initialize a CMS_ContentInfo structure like there is a
way to initialize a BIO structure (such as with BIO_new()? ). I'm looking
through openssl/cms.h but I'm not seeing anything.

2) Once again, I'm looking in openssl/cms.h, and I could not find the
function prototype &quot; d2i_CMS_ContentInfo&quot;. I even did a grep on the whole
directory. Is it located somewhere else? I have OpenSSL 1.0.1, which is
after 0.9.8 when the function was added to OpenSSL. 

3) In looking at the function prototype (via
<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/crypto/d2i_CMS_ContentInfo.html">https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/crypto/d2i_CMS_ContentInfo.html</A>):
CMS_ContentInfo *d2i_CMS_ContentInfo(CMS_ContentInfo **a, unsigned char
**pp, long length);
I'm assuming **pp is just a pointer to the array with the DER-encoded
certificate in it? I just want to make sure since some of the parameter
names are a little ambiguous in OpenSSL. 

I'm assuming once I'm able to get the DER-encoded certificate in a CMS
object, I can use the function you provided and the ones in cms.h to strip
off &quot;layers&quot; of the certificate to get the encryptedKeyPackage that I want
(which, of course as you mentioned, I'll be able to handle the rest from
there). Thank you very much for your response, as it was very helpful, and I
hope to get just as useful of a response back!

- Justin

Well if this follows RFC6032 the outer part will be a ContentInfo structure
which you can parse using d2i_CMS_ContentInfo. From there you can use
various utility functions to analyse it.

For example CMS_get0_eContentType() to get the OID corresponding to the
encapsulated content type and CMS_get0_content() which (if I read the spec
correctly) should get you the EncryptedKeyPackage structure. After that
you'll have to parse it yourself because OpenSSL doesn't support that
atructure.

Steve.
