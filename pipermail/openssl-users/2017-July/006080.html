The browsers and Java do this because they can (they control the
underlying libraries) and in order to prod the CAs into action,
and to force server operators to move to SHA2.

There is no immediate threat, but the goal is to move the ecosystem
away from SHA-1.  Now that they've done that, you don't need to
refuse SHA-1 in every piece of legacy software (e.g. OpenSSL 1.0.x).
Your contribution to purging SHA-1 from the public Internet would be
negligible.

Making your code more complex is a far higher risk than a practical
certificate forgery based on a collision attack on SHA-1.

We don't even have 2nd-preimage attacks on MD5 yet.  I'm not holding my
breath for 2nd-preimage attacks on full SHA-1.

Anyway, you can, if you wish, implement a verification callback
that makes the appropriate checks for OpenSSL 1.0.x, but my advice
is to just let the CAs get rid of SHA-1 under pressure from the
browsers, Java, ...

In OpenSSL 1.2.0 (not sure about 1.1.1) we can designate SHA-1 as too
weak for security level 1, and at that time, OpenSSL applications
linked with OpenSSL will by default refuse to validate certificate
signatures based on SHA-1.
