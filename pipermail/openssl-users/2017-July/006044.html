</I>
Yes, that is correct. If both client and server are OpenSSL then,
optionally, they can just share a session file (which contains the key)
if that is easier.

&gt;<i> From the OpenSSL code, this key is used as char * type. So does
</I>&gt;<i> it mean that any pre-decided string can be used as a key and it does not
</I>&gt;<i> need any format etc.
</I>
To me &quot;string&quot; implies NUL terminated printable string. Maybe that's not
what you meant. Anyway in that sense &quot;string&quot; is not quite correct. The
key is binary data which should be the same length as the hash used for
the ciphersuite.


&gt;<i> Both client and server create sessions based on the
</I>&gt;<i> key and connect based on the created session?
</I>&gt;<i> In one of the examples, *strspn*(psk_key, &quot;abcdefABCDEF1234567890&quot;) is
</I>&gt;<i> used. So, I believe I can use any hex value string of my choice as psk_key.
</I>
Like I said above - the key is *binary* data. It does not have to be a
printable string.


&gt;<i> 2) Also, from the man page , I found that PSK are used in TLS1.2 and
</I>&gt;<i> lower versions too and SSL_CTX_set_psk_server_callback
</I>&gt;<i> and SSL_CTX_set_psk_client_callback are used to set callback there. PSK
</I>&gt;<i>  identity and Pre shared key is set there which can be used during the
</I>&gt;<i> connection. It is also written that these values are required when using
</I>&gt;<i> PSK cipher-suites. So, is my understanding correct that the role of PSK
</I>&gt;<i> in version &lt;= TLS1.2 is only for using PSK ciphersuites
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g: ECDHE-PSK-AES256-CBC-SHA384)
</I>
Correct.

&gt;<i> and do not have anything to do with
</I>&gt;<i> session resumption and thereby do not provide any performance enhancement.
</I>
They do not have anything to do with session resumption, so you don't
see the reduced number of message flights that you get with a resumed
handshake. However, PSK ciphersuites in &lt;= TLS1.2 avoid the need to send
(and therefore process/validate) Certificate messages which may have
performance benefits. If the ciphersuite in use just uses &quot;plain&quot; PSK
(i.e. no (EC)DHE or RSA) then a connection can be established without
using public-key operations which may also have performance benefits (at
the expense of forward secrecy).

&gt;<i> Also, this PSK type ciphersuites are no longer valid for TLS 1.3.
</I>
Correct.
