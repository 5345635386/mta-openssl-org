<PRE>&gt;<i>From someone who does NOT understand the in's and out's of what people
</I>(developers and users) have been using openSSL for.
My first reaction is: have developers been using openSSL, or has it gone to
abusing it?
For the sake of argument - let's say just use as it has always been
intended.

Many technologies - especially related to security - whether it be a big
log through 'something', to skeleton keys', to digital keys, etc - we want
to be able to trust our locks. When the lock technology is no longer
trustworthy - whether it be packaging (which is what the discussion sounds
like atm) or unrepairable &quot;concerns&quot; with the technology asis - we change
our locks.

Not everyone changes locks at the same moment in time. urgency depends on
need, i.e., what is at risk.

I started following these discussions because I am concerned (remember I am
not really interested in the inner workings. I just think my locks are
broken and wondering if it is time to change to something that maybe &quot;can
do less&quot; - but what it does, does it better than what I have now.

Regardless of the choices made by openssl - people outside openssl have
needs and are looking at alternatives. To someone like me it is obvious
something must change - even if technically it is cosmetic - because
(open)SSL is losing the trust of it's users.

As a user - I need a alternative. And just as I stopped using
telnet/ftp/rsh/etc- because I could not entrust the integrity of my systems
when those doors were open - so are my concerns re: (open)SSL. In short, is
SSL still secure? And, very simply, as an un-knowledgeable user - given the
choice of a library that does something well - and that's it, versus
something else that does that - but leaves room for 'experiments' - Not on
my systems. Experiment in experiment-land.

My two bits.
