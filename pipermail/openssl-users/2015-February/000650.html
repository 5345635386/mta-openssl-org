<PRE>Hi Steve,

I read the 'The FIPS 140-2 &quot;Hostage&quot; Issue' page. Its not clear to me
what the problem is, or how OpenSSL is a hostage.

I was looking under &quot;The New Requirement&quot; for a statement of the
problem (assuming the new requirement is causing the problem), but its
escaping me (forgive my ignorance). I think the &quot;The New Requirement &quot;
section is bogged down with some background information, which is
masking out the statement being made about the problem.

If its &quot;... the change that is being demanded is that we supply
explicit version numbers for the hypervisor based platforms, so for
instance an existing platform&quot;, then why is that a problem?

How is virtualization a problem? (I know real problems exist in
virtualized environments, so PRNGs can suffer. We had one appliance
vendor tell us to do the &quot;link /dev/random to /dev/urandom trick&quot;
(sigh...)).

Can't that be worked around by having vendors provide real iron? (Most
validated platforms appear to be real iron, so it seems nothing has
changed to me).

Is it a problem on mobile platforms?

How is it holding OpenSSL hostage?

Can you provide the executive summary here?

Jeff
