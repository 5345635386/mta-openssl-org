<PRE>Hello everybody,

I'm pretty sure this has already been discussed somewhere but grepping
through the whole openssl-user list does not gave me the answer I'm
searching for, so here am I.

In my development I'm using a idiom that's not as widely used as I
thought (as I get it after multiple days of searching out there). In
order to securely distribute a binary, I encrypt it using an AES key
and the AES key itself is encrypted using a /private/ RSA key I own.
Only owners of the /public/ key (which, as it is a publilc key, may
leak) can decrypt the AES key, and therefore the binary. The reason
why I do this is that I cannot encrypt using the recipient public key
because I don't know how many different recipient I have when I
generate the encrypted binary ; and generate the binary on request is
not feasible.

With this idiom, recipient can check that I crypted the binary, and
the binary itself cannot be decrypted unless you're a recipient (i.e.
you have the public key). This has worked well for a few years.

Of course, in order to do this I rely on RSA_private_encrypt() and
RSA_public_decrypt() because EVP_PKEY_encrypt() / EVP_PKEY_decrypt()
cannot be used(*).

So, after that long introduction, here is my question : is there any
OpenSSL 3.0 sanctionned, EVP_PKEY-based way to crypt using a private
key and decrypt using a public key?

While I fully understand the need to streamline the library interface
and to remove the low-level RSA functions, it seems to me that not
allowing this is going to be problematic for those who, like me, rely
on public key decryption in their process. I also fully understand
that it's not the prefered way to do it but I (and some others, I
guess) deal with a use case which is not ideal here, and the
possibility to use asymetric crypto in this way really saves me.

Best regards,

-- Emmanuel Deloget

(*) tests on OpenSSL 1.0.2 (Ubuntu 16.04) and OpenSSL 1.1.1c (Ubuntu
19.04) shows that it segfaults in EVP_PKEY_decrypt() when feeded with
a public key. In OpenSSL 3.0, EVP_PKEY_decrypt() does not appear to be
able to decrypt using a RSA public key (it calls RSA_private_decrypt()
internally, via rsa_decrypt()).
