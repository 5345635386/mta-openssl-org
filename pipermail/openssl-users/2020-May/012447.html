The &quot;early data&quot; here is a red herring. It is normal for the internal
libssl state machine to (briefly) transition through the &quot;early data&quot;
state even though there is no early data being sent. In this case the
early data state is the last state that occurs after having written
change cipher spec, but before reading the second Client Hello following
an HRR.

I *think* what is happening here is that the server side state machine
has finished its writing tasks, and is now attempting to read data from
the client again (i.e. the 2nd ClientHello). Normally what would happen
at this point is that it would read the header of the next record that
is received from the client to check that the message type it has
received is sane. It is expecting the ClientHello message type, and only
at that point will it move the state machine on from the &quot;early data&quot;
state into the &quot;SSLv3/TLS read client hello&quot; state.

For some reason it is experiencing a failure while reading the client
hello from the client. Therefore it never makes the state transition out
of the &quot;early data&quot; state.

The SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL return suggests to me that the underlying system
call to read the data has failed for some reason. However errno being 0
indicates otherwise. There is actually a known scenario in 1.1.1 where
this can occur: if EOF is unexpectedly encountered on the socket. We
briefly fixed this (you should never normally get SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL with
errno == 0) but had to back the fix out because it broke some
applications which were written to expect this buggy behaviour.

I wonder if there could be some middlebox in between these two peers
that is interfering with the connection in some way and arbitrarily
closing it down?
