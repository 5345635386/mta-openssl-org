Yes, assuming you have negotiated an AES CBC ciphersuite in TLSv1.1 or
TLSv1.2, then that is what happens. You don't say what version of
OpenSSL you are using. Here is the code that does it for 1.1.1 (i.e.
master branch):

<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/ssl/record/ssl3_record.c#L954">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/ssl/record/ssl3_record.c#L954</A>

As can be seen on line 969 we just fill the IV with random bytes.

Perhaps you could provide a wireshark trace of the handshake which might
provide some enlightenment as to what is happening.
