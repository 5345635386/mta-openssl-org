</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   &quot;Implementor's note: the most straightforward way to implement the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   (e.g., they are not in the PSK database or are encrypted with an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   unknown key) SHOULD simply be ignored.  If no acceptable PSKs are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   found, the server SHOULD perform a non-PSK handshake if possible.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OK, it is &quot;straightforward&quot;, but I am not sure it satisfies the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; principle of least surprise.  So I am asking you what you think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; users can reasonably expect...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> TLSv1.3 PSKs are very different to TLSv1.2 PSKs. 
</I>
they're not, you have two values - identity and a secret. in TLS 1.2 identity 
could be empty, in TLS 1.3 it can't be.

in TLS 1.3 _optionally_ the PSK can have a hash explicitly associated with the 
secret. If a hash is not associated, the default sha-256  is used.

&gt;<i> In TLSv1.3 they are
</I>&gt;<i> effectively the same thing as a session (they are indistinguishable on
</I>&gt;<i> the wire) 
</I>
that's not true - static PSKs are distinguished by the obfuscated_ticket_age 
value being 0

&gt;<i> - and are handled internally by the same logic. As with any
</I>&gt;<i> session the server may or may not choose to use it.
</I>
that's an implementation detail specific to OpenSSL, and I dare say, very 
unexpected for a user

&gt;<i> If we are talking about the &quot;principle of least surprise&quot; then I would
</I>&gt;<i> find it quite surprising if the server selected a non-preferred
</I>&gt;<i> ciphersuite when a mutually supported better one exists.
</I>
except a server configured in version 1.1.0 to support just PSK will stop 
working as soon as both client and server update to 1.1.1

I'd call that &quot;surprising&quot;

&gt;<i> I suspect that most implementations will follow the advice above from
</I>&gt;<i> the spec, and again it would be quite surprising if we did something
</I>&gt;<i> different. Not only that it would add unnecessary complexity to the
</I>&gt;<i> logic in this area.
</I>
I've already talked with Nikos about situation in GnuTLS and it will support 
PSKs transparently in TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, configurations won't break.
 
&gt;<i> What is perhaps the source of any &quot;surprise&quot; that a user might
</I>&gt;<i> experience is that TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 share the same name for PSKs,
</I>&gt;<i> when really they are only related at a conceptual level: at an
</I>&gt;<i> implementation level they are totally different. Perhaps it would have
</I>&gt;<i> been better if they had been called something different. That is
</I>&gt;<i> slightly unfortunate - but not something we can do much about
</I>&gt;<i> (especially at this late stage).
</I>
that's how you see it, and having just implemented support for them, I do not 
agree
