<PRE>Hi openssl-users,

I found a memory leak in my program that arises from the use of the
BIO_do_connect() function.  It seems to be related to how openssl is
interacting with other packages on my system.  I observe this behavior
on my Arch Linux machine but not on my Debian Stretch machine.  I wrote
a minimal program that demonstrates the issue and attached the output of
valgrind of the same program.

The leak goes away if I comment out the BIO_do_connect() line, and based
on the output of valgrind the issue seems to have something to do with
the DNS resolving step.  I noticed using strace that on Arch Linux the
same binary running on Arch Linux loads two libraries that don't get
loaded when running on Debian Stretch: &quot;libnss_mymachines.so.2&quot; and
&quot;libnss_resolve.so.2&quot;.

Am I doing something wrong or is this a memory leak in openssl?

Thanks,

Ryan

// # compile with gcc 7.2.1:
// gcc -Wall -g -std=c99 -pedantic leak.c -lssl -lcrypto -o leak

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;openssl/bio.h&gt;

int main(){
    // unencrypted connection
    BIO* bio = BIO_new_connect(&quot;smtp.gmail.com:587&quot;);

    // connect BIO
    BIO_do_connect(bio);

    // read some stuff
    char buffer[1024];
    int ret = BIO_read(bio, buffer, 1024 - 1);
    printf(&quot;read %d bytes:\n&quot;,ret);
    fwrite(buffer, 1, ret, stdout);

    BIO_free_all(bio);

    printf(&quot;exiting\n&quot;);
    return 0;
}
