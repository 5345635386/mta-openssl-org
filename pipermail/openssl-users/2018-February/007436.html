<PRE>Hi All,
currently i am using openssl for client and server communication for file
transfer. i am facing some issue regarding the writing the content of
file.my requirement is i have to send the whole content of some specified
file to server for that i am using SSL_write(). i can achieve this using
SSL_write() in a while loop but my requirement is i have to use single
SSL_write() for sending whole content of file and single SSL_read  at the
server to receive the whole content of the file.because in that message
itself we  have to specify some id so that it can be identified at the
server to indicate that it is file reading. so i need to send single
message with full content of file in a buffer. because of the maximum
limitation of SSL_write() we are not able to send more than 16384 bytes.
Could somebody suggest s how can i use SSL_write() for the writing the
whole content of text file in a single message without using any while loop.

Thanks in Advance.


Thanks &amp; Regards,
Roushan Ara
