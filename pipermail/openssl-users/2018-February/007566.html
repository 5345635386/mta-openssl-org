<PRE>Hi Toby,

&gt;&gt;<i> the question remains: Is there a way to reuse an already-encrypted privkey?
</I>
I'd say yes it *could* work, but not with OpenSSL API functions. You'd
have to roll your own code for the PKCS12 creation.

OpenSSL's PKCS12_create() function expects an unencrypted EVP_PKEY
object.  But, internally, that key is turned into a encrypted PKCS8
structure, as expected by the PKCS8ShroudedKeyBag type defined in RFC-7292.

Thats why I think it may be possible to experiment and modify code such
as in crypto/pkcs12/p12_crt.c, trying to pass-through that already
encrypted PKCS8 key &quot;as-is&quot; straight into the pkcs8ShroudedKeyBag
object. If your key is a file in PEM format, you'd need to get that into
an internal structure first (more coding), I don't think there is a
simple API import (without decryption).

If you manage to successfully built that PKCS12, you'd run into trouble
for decoding, which probably fails for all known software. They all
expect to be able to read the private key, when in your case it needs
saving to a file somewhere for further handling, or for entering that
second key-specific password.  You'd again have to code your own PKCS12
unpack program, just for this specific use case.

I may be wrong but to me it looks doable, just a *lot* of work.
