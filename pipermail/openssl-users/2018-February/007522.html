TLSv1.3 PSKs are very different to TLSv1.2 PSKs. In TLSv1.3 they are
effectively the same thing as a session (they are indistinguishable on
the wire) - and are handled internally by the same logic. As with any
session the server may or may not choose to use it.

If we are talking about the &quot;principle of least surprise&quot; then I would
find it quite surprising if the server selected a non-preferred
ciphersuite when a mutually supported better one exists.

I suspect that most implementations will follow the advice above from
the spec, and again it would be quite surprising if we did something
different. Not only that it would add unnecessary complexity to the
logic in this area.

What is perhaps the source of any &quot;surprise&quot; that a user might
experience is that TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 share the same name for PSKs,
when really they are only related at a conceptual level: at an
implementation level they are totally different. Perhaps it would have
been better if they had been called something different. That is
slightly unfortunate - but not something we can do much about
(especially at this late stage).

I strongly feel this is the correct behaviour.
