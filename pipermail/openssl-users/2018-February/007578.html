That's nice from the server's POV, but the client REALLY REALLY SHOULD
NOT install and/or put trust into any CA certs it received in-band in a
connection that failed verification. The best (for you) it can do is to
store it and offer it to its user for additional verification and *then*
installation - and I'ld venture a guess that you'ld have to write such a
client yourself.

(And offering the *root* certificate isn't that far from the common
practice of a server sending *most* of its CA chain in addition to its
own certificate, anyway, so it's debatable whether you even *need* the
result of the client's verification as an input to send the root as well.)

Kind regards,
