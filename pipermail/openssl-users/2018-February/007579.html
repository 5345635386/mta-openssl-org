<PRE>No, you cannot query the SSL layer to know if the client validated the
certificate.  SSL/TLS don't provide any means of querying the remote
side.

Here's how the workflow works:

1) client doesn't trust certificate, doesn't override distrust:
connection closes with fatal unknown_ca or expired_certificate alert.
2) client doesn't trust certificate, does override distrust:
connection continues.  No way to query if distrust was overridden.
3) client does trust certificate, no need to override: connection
continues.  No way to query if distrust was overridden.

There's no way for the server to know if the client trusts the
certificate, or if the client overrode the distrust.

There's generally also no way for Javascript on the client to know
this, either.  However, because this is a list about OpenSSL (and not
about any given application of OpenSSL, i.e. the web) it's not the
best place to ask about how to do this on the web.

Certificate chain updates (to avoid chain expiration) by the server
are expected to be done unilaterally, by the server operator.

If different certificate chains need to be provided to different
clients, the different clients can request different hostnames (via
the Server Name Indication extension) so the server can decide which
certificate chain to present.

As much as it sucks, this is the only server certificate selection
mechanism that exists in SSL/TLS.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes that is true.... however here's the scenario.

</I>&gt;<i> If it failed, provide a option for the client to get a renewed certificate

</I>&gt;<i> lies *no* but did, then give him the root cert he already has.... *noop*
