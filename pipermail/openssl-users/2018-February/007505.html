<PRE>Hi Matt, thanks for your prompt answer. The testclient is using openssl-1.0.2m and my previous assumption that the IV was derived from the key_block as in TLS 1.0 was wrong. 
It seems that when initialising the cipher with the IV is ignored when the crypto is AES and the first 16 bytes of the encrypted payload is used as IV (as per TLS spec). This is a Java issue 
and has nothing to do with OpenSSL but assuming this is correct behaviour (I'll have to dig in to that) I use the same logic (in this respect) for TLS1.1 and TLS1.2  assuming that
the client also does which it obviously does not. 

Below is the logging from my server handling two authentications (the Finished message that is the first encrypted). The first (TLS1.1) succeeds and the second (1.2) fails. You can see that the decrypted text is correctly padded in the first case (TLS 1.1) indicating that the decryption succeeded but the second (1.2) decrypted buffer does not. The &quot;Finished&quot; message for this (AES; SHA) mac- and block size should be padded with 11 bytes which the first is. 
Also as seen I use the same provider and algoritm in the two cases, actually I handle the decryption in the same way for the two TLS-levels


Also added the wireshark output for the two authentications where I've verified that the logged encrypted data really is whats coming in on the line. 


Basically when selecting 1.1 in the client everything works as expected but selecting 1.2 the prepended IV is not correct as far as I understand. The testclient vendor says they are using
OpenSLL for TLS handling so I expect that they're not fiddling with any IV bytes at all. Given the version 1.0.2m, can this be explained?
