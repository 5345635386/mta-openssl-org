<PRE>Hi,

That's about what I thought I figured out, yeah. :)

&gt;<i> Thats why I think it may be possible to experiment and modify code such

</I>&gt;<i> encrypted PKCS8 key &quot;as-is&quot; straight into the pkcs8ShroudedKeyBag

</I>&gt;<i> an internal structure first (more coding), I don't think there is a
</I>&gt;<i> simple API import (without decryption).
</I>&gt;<i> If you manage to successfully built that PKCS12, you'd run into trouble

</I>&gt;<i> unpack program, just for this specific use case.
</I>&gt;<i> I may be wrong but to me it looks doable, just a *lot* of work.
</I>
... and that, unfortunately, is about what I concluded as well. Bummer. ;-)

But thanks a lot for your thoughts (also to Jakob and Viktor)! :)

Cheers,
Toby.
