<PRE>I am trying to use the s_client feature to retrieve certificates from other SMPT servers. The s_client connection works to other z/OS systems, but fails to any ASCII based mail server. Tracing the connections show that the EHLO goes out in EBCDIC and the responding server claims unknown command. This make sense on the surface.

Is there a way to force the outbound to ASCII data stream (supported by z/OS on other connections), or is there a way to install OPENSSL using ASCII under the z/OS OMVS umbrella?

Thanks for your help,
