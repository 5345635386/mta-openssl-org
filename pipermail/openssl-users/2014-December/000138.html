Can you give more details about this?  Please note the binary
compatibility will only work if you used the same options to build
the library.  (This is one of the reasons to make more structures
opaque.)

&gt;<i>   Also the 1.0.1 changelog includes at least one change of binary
</I>&gt;<i>  flag values to get a different compatibility behavior than
</I>&gt;<i>  previous 1.0.1 releases, thus there is not even binary
</I>&gt;<i>  compatibility within 1.0.1 .
</I>
I assume you're talking about SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1?  It's unfortunate
that SSL_OP_ALL already contained that in 1.0.0 while 1.0.0
doesn't even know anything about TLS 1.1.  But that only affects
people who compiled with 1.0.1 or 1.0.1a headers.

&gt;<i>  must choose one of the stabilized 1.0.x releases (1.0.0 or 1.0.1)

</I>
I think people should stop using both 0.9.8 and 1.0.0 as soon as
possible since they do not support TLS 1.2.  You really want to use
TLS 1.2.

&gt;<i>   The best you can do is to split libcrypt into two or tree well

</I>&gt;<i>  nothing more fancy)
</I>
I don't think we intend to remove functions like AES_* yet but
might deprecate them in favour APIs that exist for a very long
time.  Please note that for instance using the AES functions you
do not have AESNI acceleration but by using the EVP interfance you
do.
