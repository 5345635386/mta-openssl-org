<PRE>Thanks for the quick response.

I compiled it with the EBCDIC option. I think that is my problem. The EHLO goes out in EBCDIC to an ASCII server. So then I receive an invalid command response, makes sense.

When I point to another z/OS system to retrieve the certs it goes out EBCDIC and responds properly with the cert chain. But in this dual EBCDIC example both sides are talking the same language.

When I trace inbound to z/OS from an ASCII machine, z/OS recognizes the ASCII and does its magic.

What I need to happen is the z/OS version to be sent in ASCII so the other side can read it.

I hope I am making sense.

Thanks for your help on this.

A quick look at apps/s_client.c in the 1.0.1j sources suggests that it does EBCDIC-ASCII translation if it was compiled with CHARSET_EBCDIC.

What version are you using? Was it built with CHARSET_EBCDIC defined?

Subject: [openssl-users] Using s_client under z/OS installation

I am trying to use the s_client feature to retrieve certificates from other SMPT servers. The s_client connection works to other z/OS systems, but fails to any ASCII based mail server. Tracing the connections show that the EHLO goes out in EBCDIC and the responding server claims unknown command. This make sense on the surface.

Is there a way to force the outbound to ASCII data stream (supported by z/OS on other connections), or is there a way to install OPENSSL using ASCII under the z/OS OMVS umbrella?
