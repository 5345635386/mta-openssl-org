 |Yes. I am.
 |
 |&gt;   pam_xdg.so is a PAM module that manages creation of the
 |&gt;   XDG_RUNTIME_DIR directory, as well as injection of environment
 |&gt;   variables denoting all directories specified by the XDG Base
 |&gt;   Directory Specification:

 |&gt;          latest.html
 |&gt;   into user sessions.
 |&gt; 
 |&gt; yet the mailing-list is hosted by RedHat, and somehow i could not
 |&gt; subscribe to _that_ screen, maybe script related, i do not know.
 |&gt; Just in case of interest [1-3].  ISC license, but you could have
 |&gt; it Public Domain if you want.

 |The PAM developer discussion is on:
 |<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">pam-developers at lists.fedorahosted.org</A>

Ah, i was trying <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">pam-list at redhat.com</A> without success.  I even
tried to contact the administrators, but nothing as silence.  ..So
i was waiting until some day i see one of the names mentioned.

 |If you could submit the module as PR on the GitHub Linux PAM project

 |I know, that would require getting a GitHub account.

Yes, ach, no.  It is just a trivial thing, and not even needed on
the omnipresent systemd Linux; i was just writing it because
someone here on (systemd-free) CRUX Linux was carrying along some
PAM-module daemon written in a language noone has the interpreter
for by default, that did nothing but managing a session counter
... rundird it was, written in zig.  (It fooled me to believe that
PAM could gracefully handle sessions, i did not think about it
myself; until a &quot;daemonized&quot; / reparented to init shell script was
living in a directory that should have been gone, and then
i rewrote the module to the minimum implementation that it is.)

Ah! and oh! on my evil subconsciousness.

Good night.

(And sorry again for bringing this off-topic thing here.)
