</I>&gt;<i> Its a really good question and I've often wondered the same thing. The decision was made before my time. I suspect it was about keeping binary sizes down, but I can't imagine it would make that much difference. I have previously considered turning it on by default but never quite got around to it.

If you don't have any objections I could submit a PR to enable it by default?  I'd image that the platforms that'd care about a few extra kb are in the minority, and it makes such a huge difference having SSL_trace() when trying to debug TLS 1.3 issues.
