</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Its a really good question and I've often wondered the same thing. The decision was made before my time. I suspect it was about keeping binary sizes down, but I can't imagine it would make that much difference. I have previously considered turning it on by default but never quite got around to it.

I have no objections although you'll have to be quick if you want it 
considered for 3.0. Since it would just be about changing the default 
people that care about the extra kb can still disable it.
