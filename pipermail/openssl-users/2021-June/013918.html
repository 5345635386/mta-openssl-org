<PRE>Dear @ll

My environment:

OpenSSL 1.1.1f  31 Mar 2020

Ubuntu 20.04

Server version: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Server built:   2021-06-17T18:27:53

My problem:

connecting to a secure server requiring client certificate, i get the 
following error when presenting my certificate:

ERR_BAD_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH_CERT

It started to fail after the previous one voided and i issued a new one.

CA, the same, server cert, renewed after previous voided.

My server conf:

                 #   number which specifies how deeply to verify the 
certificate
                 #   issuer chain before deciding the certificate is not 
valid.
                 #SSLVerifyClient require
                 #SSLVerifyDepth  10

                 #   SSL Engine Options:
                 #   Set various options for the SSL engine.
                 #   o FakeBasicAuth:
                 #        Translate the client X.509 into a Basic 
Authorisation.  This means that
                 #        the standard Auth/DBMAuth methods can be used 
for access control.  The
                 #        user name is the `one line' version of the 
client's X.509 certificate.
                 #        Note that no password is obtained from the 
user. Every entry in the user
                 #        file needs this password: `xxj31ZMTZzkVA'.
                 #   o ExportCertData:
                 #        This exports two additional environment 
variables: SSL_CLIENT_CERT and
                 #        SSL_SERVER_CERT. These contain the PEM-encoded 
certificates of the
                 #        server (always existing) and the client (only 
existing when client
                 #        authentication is used). This can be used to 
import the certificates
                 #        into CGI scripts.
                 #   o StdEnvVars:
                 #        This exports the standard SSL/TLS related 
`SSL_*' environment variables.
                 #        Per default this exportation is switched off 
for performance reasons,
                 #        because the extraction step is an expensive 
operation and is usually
                 #        useless for serving static content. So one 
usually enables the
                 #        exportation for CGI and SSI requests only.
                 #   o OptRenegotiate:
                 #        This enables optimized SSL connection 
renegotiation handling when SSL
                 #        directives are used in per-directory context.
                 #SSLOptions +FakeBasicAuth +ExportCertData +StrictRequire
                 &lt;FilesMatch &quot;\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php)$&quot;&gt;
                                 SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
                 &lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
                 &lt;Directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin&gt;
                                 SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
                 &lt;/Directory&gt;

                 #   SSL Protocol Adjustments:
                 #   The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard 
compliant shutdown
                 #   approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify 
alert but doesn't wait for
                 #   the close notify alert from client. When you need a 
different shutdown
                 #   approach you can use one of the following variables:
                 #   o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
                 #        This forces an unclean shutdown when the 
connection is closed, i.e. no
                 #        SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to 
received.  This violates
                 #        the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some 
brain-dead browsers. Use
                 #        this when you receive I/O errors because of 
the standard approach where
                 #        mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
                 #   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
                 #        This forces an accurate shutdown when the 
connection is closed, i.e. a
                 #        SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl 
waits for the close notify
                 #        alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS 
standard compliant, but in
                 #        practice often causes hanging connections with 
brain-dead browsers. Use
                 #        this only for browsers where you know that 
their SSL implementation
                 #        works correctly.
                 #   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also 
related to the HTTP
                 #   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally 
want to disable
                 #   keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable 
&quot;nokeepalive&quot; for this.
                 #   Similarly, one has to force some clients to use 
HTTP/1.0 to workaround
                 #   their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables 
&quot;downgrade-1.0&quot; and
                 #   &quot;force-response-1.0&quot; for this.
                 # BrowserMatch &quot;MSIE [2-6]&quot; \
                 #               nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
