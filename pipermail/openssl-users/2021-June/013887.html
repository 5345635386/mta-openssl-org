<PRE>Thanks for the response Ben!

We are targeting TLS1.2. For testing, we have one server that has both callbacks enabled. On the client side, we have two clients, 1 establishing SRP connections with the usual calls (set_srp_username,set_srp_password) and it works. The other client establishes connections via PSK. 

Running callback only for SRP on the server with a client connecting via SRP works. Its just that when you try to add a PSK callback on the server with the SRP callback, the SRP callbacks don't work anymore for SRP clients when PSK clients are still able to with both callbacks being triggered/registered. 

Here is a quick summary of the test scenarios we have:
1. SRP client with SRP callback only - works
2. PSK client with PSK callback only - works
3. SRP client with SRP+PSK callbacks - doesn't work
4. PSK client with SRP+PSK callbacks - works

Main issue is that the SRP callback doesn't seem to play well with PSK callback. Let me know if there is any other information I may have not supplied so I can try to explain further.

So an alternative would be to set these individually on the SSL context. I have also confirmed that SRP and PSK cipher suites when combined when being set is a non-issue.

</I>
The situation is somewhat different between TLS 1.3 and prior versions (e.g., TLS 1.2).
Since there isn't currently a defined SRP option for TLS 1.3, I assume you are targeting TLS 1.2

I think you need to say more about your testing -- whether SRP or PSK is being attempted for TLS 1.2 is at the control of the client, as the ClientKeyExchange protocol message will have a different structure for using SRP vs using PSK.  If your client is never trying SRP, then of course your SRP callback will never be called.

So, how are you testing the various scenarios?
