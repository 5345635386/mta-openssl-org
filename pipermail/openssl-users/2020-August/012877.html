I suspect this is the way most people do it.

We should really have a proper callback for this purpose. PRs welcome!
(Doesn't help you right now though).

</I>
The async API is meant for any scenario where user code may want to
perform async processing. Its design is NOT restricted to engines -
although that is certainly where it is normally used. However there are
no assumptions made anywhere that it will be exclusively restricted to
engines.

ASYNC_block_pause() is intended as a user level API, and a quick search
of the  codebase reveals that the only place we use it internally is in
our tests - it does not appear in the library code. The intention is
that you should be able to rely on being inside a job in any callbacks,
if you've started the connection inside one.

&quot;Somewhat counter-intuitively, the OpenSSL async API is meant for
activities that can work correctly _without_ becoming asynchronous (i.e.
without being paused to temporary give way to other activities)&quot;

I have no idea what you mean by this. The whole point of
ASYNC_pause_job() is to temporarily give way to other activities.

One issue you might encounter with the ASYNC APIs is that they are not
available on some less-common platforms. Basically anything without
setcontext/swapcontext support (e.g. IIRC I think android may fall into
this category).

&gt;<i> Can you think of another trick?
</I>
One possibility that springs to mind (which is also an ugly hack) is to
defer the validation of the certificates. So, you have a verify callback
that always says &quot;ok&quot;. But any further reads on the underlying BIO
always return with &quot;retry&quot; until such time as any intermediate
certificates have been fetched and the chain has been verified &quot;for
real&quot;. The main problem I can see with this approach is there is no easy
way to send the right alert back to the server in the event of failure.


&gt;<i> P.S. Squid does not support BoringSSL, but BoringSSL's
</I>&gt;<i> SSL_ERROR_WANT_CERTIFICATE_VERIFY result of the certificate validation
</I>&gt;<i> callback seemingly addresses our use case. I do not know whether OpenSSL
</I>&gt;<i> decision makers would be open to adding something along those lines and
</I>&gt;<i> decided to ask for existing solutions here before proposing adding
</I>&gt;<i> SSL_ERROR_WANT_TIME :-).
</I>
I'd definitely be open to adding it - although it wouldn't be backported
to a stable branch.
