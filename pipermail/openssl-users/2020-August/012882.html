Yes, it clarifies what you meant. And, yes, its true that strictly
speaking that *could* happen. ASYNC_block_pause() was introduced to
handle the problem where we are holding a lock and therefore must not
return control to the user without releasing that lock. As a general
rule we want to keep the sections of code that perform work under a lock
to an absolute minimum. It would not seem like a great idea to me to
call user callbacks from libssl while holding such a lock. We have no
idea what those callbacks are going to do, and which APIs they will
call. The chances of a deadlock occurring seem very high under those
circumstances, unless restrictions are placed on what the callback can
do, and those restrictions are very clearly documented.

So, yes you are right. But in practice I'm not sure how much I'd really
worry about this theoretical restriction. That's of course for you to
decide.

</I>
Hmm. Yes this is a problem with the current implementation. The
selection of STACKSIZE is somewhat arbitrary. It would be nice if the
stack size grew as required, but I'm not sure if that's even technically
possible. A workaround might be for us to expose some API to set it -
but exposing such internal details is also quite horrible.

</I>
Does squid use the DANE APIs? If not I'm not sure it makes much
difference. In any case the &quot;manipulation&quot; seems limited to setting DANE
information in the X509_STORE_CTX which presumably could be replicated by:

X509_STORE_CTX_set0_dane(ctx, SSL_get0_dane());

However, I'm not really the person to ask about the DANE implementation.
Maybe Viktor Dukhovni will chip in with his thoughts.
