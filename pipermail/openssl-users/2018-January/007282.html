</I>&gt;<i> I could make a new one (or more-specifically, destroy the existing one
</I>&gt;<i> and re-initialize it), but that is more-complicated as the application
</I>&gt;<i> in question is multi-threaded -- and it's not at all clear from the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation if I destroy a context that has SSLs that have been
</I>&gt;<i> generated from it will cause &quot;bad things&quot; to happen (like a deference
</I>&gt;<i> on a freed object!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Each SSL holds a reference on its parent SSL_CTX (and another reference
on its associated session_ctx, which starts out as the same SSL_CTX
object); SSL_CTX_free() does not do any deallocation until the refcount
drops to zero.

So, no &quot;bad things&quot; will happen if you SSL_CTX_free() the handle you
have in your application while SSL objects are still using that object.

&gt;<i> The reason I may want to rekey is that the cert/key pair used for that
</I>&gt;<i> context may have changed.&#160; The user's certificate may have expired for
</I>&gt;<i> example (or been revoked) and I wish to reload it (and the matching
</I>&gt;<i> key) without having to shut down the software and restart it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In general, making configuration changes to an SSL_CTX after it has been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> used to generate SSL objects is a risky proposition -- the locking model
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does not really account for doing synchronization properly, and there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might be some latent race conditions.&#160; In practice, some operations are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currently safe, but there is no authoritative list of which ones, and at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least my personal recommendation is to not try to rely on it.
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming that there are SSL objects that are in use and I destroy and
</I>&gt;<i> re-generate the CTX from which it was generated, is *THAT* safe?&#160; Or
</I>&gt;<i> do I need to flag all the in-use descendants and wait for them to be
</I>&gt;<i> closed (or force them closed and release them) before I can safely
</I>&gt;<i> destroy the context? 
</I>
You do not need to flag and wait, due to the reference counting on the
SSL and SSL_CTX objects.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the CA chain trying to load the same component that is already in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there returns a failure (somewhat-expected; that is, it does not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> overwrite but rather adds, and if you try to add what's already there
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you get an error back) and there's no call to CLEAR the certificate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> validation chain -- if I want to *replace* the validation chain I have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to destroy the context and initialize a new one from scratch.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> N.B. that the X509_STORE_add_cert behavior when presented with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> duplicate certificate changed in commit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> c0452248ea1a59a41023a4765ef7d9825e80a62b (from returning an error to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing nothing and returning success); this will be in 1.1.1.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As to the desired behavior, there does not seem to be an API to remove
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an entry from an X509_STORE.&#160; With the above caveat about thread-safety
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in mind, couldn't you just make a call to SSL_CTX_set{1}_cert_store() to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> replace the X509_STORE without tearing down the whole SSL_CTX?
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I didn't see one either.&#160; I'm not particularly concerned about
</I>&gt;<i> the verification chain being able to be modified while &quot;in-use&quot;; that
</I>&gt;<i> ought not happen except in an extreme circumstance (e.g. the
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate cert's key is compromised and thus both it and the cert
</I>&gt;<i> have to be regenerated and re-distributed.)&#160; If it DOES happen when
</I>&gt;<i> the end-entity cert and key are reloaded (as they've been signed from
</I>&gt;<i> the new intermediate) they'll fail to validate against the old chain
</I>&gt;<i> and the user will get plenty of notice that there's trouble.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It appears, however, that I *can* load over the top of a certificate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and private key of the same type and that's acceptable.&#160; In other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> words, if I have an RSA key/cert pair in the context and I load
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> another one, the first one is replaced.&#160; This *looks* to be working ok
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> as far as I can tell and it doesn't appear to leak memory doing that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but it's not explicitly stated that this is considered acceptable
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (rather than destroying and re-creating the context.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The leaf certificate and private key are stored as arrays (for different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> types of certificates) of pointers in the associated CERT structure, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the &quot;set&quot; routines do not currently check for and error out if there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already one set.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but do they replace the pointer and, if they do, do they
</I>&gt;<i> decrement the reference counter on the existing one before replacing
</I>&gt;<i> it so it will get freed?&#160;&#160; If yes then all is ok but if not then I
</I>&gt;<i> need to destroy the context otherwise I'm going to be leaking memory. 
</I>
The underlying implementation (ssl_set_cert()) does call X509_free() and
EVP_PKEY_free() before doing the update, so there is no leak.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Is my understanding correct?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mostly ... but I am not sure that your desired workflow is wise.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -Ben
</I>&gt;<i> If it's safe to destroy a context with potential SSL options from it
</I>&gt;<i> still in existence then it's pretty easy to do it the other way
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise I have some work to do in order to make sure all the
</I>&gt;<i> potential objects created from the parent have gone away before the
</I>&gt;<i> old context is destroyed.
</I>
Yup, it's safe.

Good luck!

-Ben
