Why not just use AUTO_DH (the only option for 1.1.0, IIRC)?

Why do you need to rekey the context as opposed to making a new one?

In general, making configuration changes to an SSL_CTX after it has been
used to generate SSL objects is a risky proposition -- the locking model
does not really account for doing synchronization properly, and there
might be some latent race conditions.&#160; In practice, some operations are
currently safe, but there is no authoritative list of which ones, and at
least my personal recommendation is to not try to rely on it.

&gt;<i> the CA chain trying to load the same component that is already in
</I>&gt;<i> there returns a failure (somewhat-expected; that is, it does not
</I>&gt;<i> overwrite but rather adds, and if you try to add what's already there
</I>&gt;<i> you get an error back) and there's no call to CLEAR the certificate
</I>&gt;<i> validation chain -- if I want to *replace* the validation chain I have
</I>&gt;<i> to destroy the context and initialize a new one from scratch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
N.B. that the X509_STORE_add_cert behavior when presented with a
duplicate certificate changed in commit
c0452248ea1a59a41023a4765ef7d9825e80a62b (from returning an error to
doing nothing and returning success); this will be in 1.1.1.

As to the desired behavior, there does not seem to be an API to remove
an entry from an X509_STORE.&#160; With the above caveat about thread-safety
in mind, couldn't you just make a call to SSL_CTX_set{1}_cert_store() to
replace the X509_STORE without tearing down the whole SSL_CTX?

&gt;<i> It appears, however, that I *can* load over the top of a certificate
</I>&gt;<i> and private key of the same type and that's acceptable.&#160; In other
</I>&gt;<i> words, if I have an RSA key/cert pair in the context and I load
</I>&gt;<i> another one, the first one is replaced.&#160; This *looks* to be working ok
</I>&gt;<i> as far as I can tell and it doesn't appear to leak memory doing that
</I>&gt;<i> but it's not explicitly stated that this is considered acceptable
</I>&gt;<i> (rather than destroying and re-creating the context.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The leaf certificate and private key are stored as arrays (for different
types of certificates) of pointers in the associated CERT structure, and
the &quot;set&quot; routines do not currently check for and error out if there is
already one set.

&gt;<i> Is my understanding correct?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Mostly ... but I am not sure that your desired workflow is wise.

-Ben
