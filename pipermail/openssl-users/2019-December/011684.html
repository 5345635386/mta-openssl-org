<PRE>Hello,
I've done some research of other peoples opinions and that's the best I can do. Please advise SVP.
I want to us ECDSA for my Web server's SSL certificate via an ACME client to Let's Encrypt and maybe later BuyPass.
I thought that EC is better than RSA, but now I don't think so. The answer seems to be: it depends.
Safe Curves (SafeCurves: Introduction) says that the NIST curves are P-224, P-256 (ye prime256v1 and what I was trying to implement with Python3 ACME client), and P-384 and NOT SAFE. They did not mention RSA. They give key type Curve25519 a fully passing grade. I think that is ye X25519, also know as ed25519. Linux program ssh has ed25519. I don't trust NIST 'cause I don't trust NSA.

This suggests that RSA keys are mostly safe: Is it still safe to use RSA Encryption? - Hashed Out by The SSL Store&#8482;

RSA could potentially be cracked by careless implementation, but does that mean it&#8217;s broken? Let&#8217;s talk about RS...

So my conclusion is to prefer in descending order of preference: ed25519, RSA-4096 (I suppose RSA-8196 is sorta overkill maybe. I suspect quantum computers would make it not overkill, but then mobile devises might not like it for the overhead.)

My local version of openssl is:OpenSSL 1.1.1d&#160; 10 Sep 2019
When I openssl ecparam -list_curves I do NOT get X25519.
However, I was apple to generate a private key per ye documentation (manpage for genpkey): /docs/man1.1.0/man1/genpkey.html

Hey, I have that manpage on my linux. So whadayouknow? My remote virtual machine has OpenSSL 1.0.2g&#160; 1 Mar 2016 and no X25519.
On my local machine, the CSR generation fails only for the X25519 private key:
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

Two-letter Country Code [US]:
139873970037888:error:0608D096:digital envelope routines:EVP_PKEY_sign_init:operation not supported for this keytype:../crypto/evp/pmeth_fn.c:40:

Supposing I can get a resolution to using X25519, anybody know of how to get the X and Y coordinates of a public key of type X29915 in the Python3 language? The PYPI repository has python-jose, which uses pyca/cryptography, which is in PYPI as plain, old 'cryptography 2.8'. My exploration of pyca/cryptography's documentation is what led me to the safe curves webpage. Maybe I can get the x and y coordinates with it. Looks scary.
So any informed assessments on:(1) key types RSA, PRIME-256, and ed25519,(2) on openssl and X25519, or(3) getting the X and Y coordinates of the ed25519 public key for making a JSON Web Key (JWK) for a ACME client in Python3.
The ACME protocol is rfc8555 and refers to 'the &quot;EdDSA&quot; signature algorithm using the &quot;Ed25519&quot; variant'. Interestingly, rfc 7518 for JWA (A is for Algorithms) does not have ed25519--though I can't rule out a standards repository somewhere could have it as an addition, for all I know--and does have the curves P-256, P-384, and P-521.
Emhhm.

Maybe I should just use RSA and likewise regress to ed for all my editing needs. I knew a consultant who used ed and was quite good. My supervisor joked about rubbing two sticks together. I'm sure there's lot of vi fans here. 'Twas the night before Christmas and I was stirring. Stirring I tell ya. Me and a mouse.
