&gt;<i> If you don't know or care what FIPS 140-2 is, be very glad this isn't &gt; your problem and turn your charitable attentions to some worthy &gt;
</I>cause. &gt; &gt; The CMVP has introduced a new policy that will result in the
&gt;<i> effective termination of many extant validations if they are not &gt;
</I>updated by January 31 2016[1]. That update is a pure paper shuffle &gt; --
adding politically correct verbiage to the Security Policy &gt; document --
but without it the CMVP will &quot;de-list&quot; the validation. &gt; &gt; ... &gt; &gt; So if
you're a corporate user of the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module
&gt;<i>v2.0 validation(s) #1747/#2398/#2473, and want to continue using
</I>&gt;<i>it past January 31, please be aware we'll need someone to cover
</I>&gt;<i>that $1250 cost. &gt; &gt; Don't send any money to us; if you're interested
</I>in covering this &gt; cost I'll put you directly in touch with the test lab
to work out &gt; specific payment arrangements. &gt; &gt; ...

I'm getting private queries about this (why is there is such reluctance
to discuss the delights of FIPS 140-2 in public?). To save some time
here's an anonymous query I received, with my reply:

&gt;&gt;<i> ... We are thinking of using openssl FIPS in our product but &gt;&gt; haven't started the work yet. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What will be the impacts to
</I>people like us who want to use the &gt;&gt; OpenSSL FIPS modules but haven't
started yet? Should we still use &gt;&gt; the modules now or should we wait? &gt;
&gt;<i> Well, the #1747/#2398/#2473 validation is very widely used, so &gt; while
</I>the CMVP may block our future FIPS related initiatives I don't &gt; think
they would dare kill those validations outright. Some &gt; stakeholder will
pay the cost to surmount this latest obstacle, in &gt; fact we have had
some contacts already. &gt; &gt; So I think you have safety in numbers if you
decide to use that &gt; module now, and should be good for the next year or
two. Keep
&gt;<i>in mind though that the long term future of the FIPS module is in
</I>&gt;<i>doubt, as the upcoming OpenSSL 1.1 release may not have any FIPS
</I>&gt;<i>support(at least initially). We're not going to try tackling a sixth new
</I>&gt;<i>open source based validation on an at-risk basis like we've done in
</I>&gt;<i>the past, as we think that risk is now too high. A new validation will
</I>&gt;<i> require a sponsor willing to absorb that risk and champion the new &gt;
</I>validation within the government bureaucracy, and we have no such &gt;
current prospects. &gt; &gt;&gt; Will there be any code changes in the modules
and will there be
&gt;&gt;<i>new version of module (or will it be just the policy document &gt;&gt;
</I>updated)? &gt; &gt; It's just a paper shuffle with no real-world impacts for
end users.
