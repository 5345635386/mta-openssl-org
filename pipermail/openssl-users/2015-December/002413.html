<PRE>Thanks Jakob &amp; Michael for your reply.
I'm using openssl to interact with apple's APNS server. Sending data as
fast as possible, most of the time APNS server don't reply, but in some
circumstance, APNS server will rely with a response and then close the
connection. So the RST is expected most of the time if APNS don't process
all received data.

At first i doubt this is maybe properties of TCP : tcp discard received
data on RST.  and i do some test on TCP not openssl.
1. client
write data until the connection is broken, sleep for a number of seconds,
then try to read. the response can be read.
2. server
on accept, don't read the data, sleep for a number of seconds. and write
some bytes ,then just exit.
here is result of tcpdump on closing:

09:50:10.188952 IP xx.90.82.138.irisa &gt; 10.241.95.197.48252: Flags [P.],
seq 730306105:730306205, ack 1556413186
Connection was reset.,nop,TS val 118133437 ecr 511650777], length 100

09:50:10.188963 IP 10.241.95.197.48252 &gt; xx.90.82.138.irisa: Flags [.], ack
100, win 6, options [nop,nop,TS val
511653112 ecr 118133437], length 0

09:50:10.188971 IP xx.90.82.138.irisa &gt; 10.241.95.197.48252: Flags [R.],
seq 100, ack 1, win 39, options [nop,no
p,TS val 118133437 ecr 511650777], length 0

It seems that if data is placed in socket buffer, it can be read. So the
received package could be discard in TCP stack?

Thank you very much.

&gt;<i> Just to amplify on Jakob's response: the reason that sometimes you see the
