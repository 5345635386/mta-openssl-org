I'm pleased to report that this $1250 cost to paper-shuffle the
#1747/#2398/#2473 validations has been covered, by Datagravity Inc.
Within minutes of hearing of the issue for the first time the the CEO,
Paula Long, not only had a check en route to the test lab but also sent
a scan of the check and envelope as a heads-up for the lab.

It's refreshing to encounter a company, and not a tiny one at that,
which can complete the see-decide-act cycle in Internet time, when
others would just be warming up for a days or weeks long odyssey through
the bowels of an in-house corporate bureaucratic process.

In covering this cost Datagravity has not only addressed direct impacts
to their business from the threatened de-listing, but has also bailed
out the hundreds of commercial vendors and government agencies using
those validations.

Note it is still possible that those validations may still be briefly
de-listed, as the paperwork hasn't been submitted yet. Hopefully that
will happen this week, but the CMVP backlog for acting on such
submissions is typically several months and the deadline for de-listing
is only six weeks away during a time of year when the CMVP tends to move
at less than breakneck speed. I do not know for sure that they will
defer that when the requisite paperwork is sitting unreviewed in their
inbox.
