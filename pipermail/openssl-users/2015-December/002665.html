<PRE>Thank you both for your responses.

I changed to cross-certifying at the root and it worked as expected.

However, cross-certification doesn't have to be at the root, going by 
RFC 4949's definition.  Neither do any of my text books on the subject 
state that it has to be at the root CA level.

Now, as Chrome on Android uses OpenSSL does this mean that this browser 
behaves differently to the mainstream browsers when it come across some 
cross-certified CAs? Namely, those who cross-certify at policy or 
issuing CA level?
