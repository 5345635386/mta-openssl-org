Three companies answered this call to cover the cost of the &quot;X9.31 RNG
transition&quot; paper shuffle. Datagravity (<A HREF="http://datagravity.com/">http://datagravity.com/</A>) acted
quickly and decisively, and the requisite paperwork has begun its
journey through the bowels of the FIPS 140-2 bureaucracy.

I would like to note that another company, Niksun (<A HREF="https://niksun.com/">https://niksun.com/</A>)
also contacted the test lab to make arrangement for payment of that fee.
If not for Datagravity beating them to the punch they would have been
the benefactor for this very necessary action.

The third company (not named here by request) was vigorously pursuing an
in-house approvals process and would also have covered this effort.

I thank all three for volunteering to bail out the entire community of
OpenSSL FIPS module users.
