<PRE>Hi Michael,
Thanks for your reply, and appreciate your answer which clear many of my
doubts.

Currently i'm stuck with this problem, can't find a way out,let me give
more context of my problem.
I use non-blocking openssl  to interact with Apple's APNS server to send
notifications to Iphone devices.

According to protocol of APNS server, most of the time, there is no
response from server; nevertheless ,if bad things happens, server will send
a reply and close the underlying connection.The reply, which is very short,
 should be fit in one TCP segment.This can be confirmed by result of
tcpdump, which i post at the beginning in this thread.

So I always write to server until write operation fails, then i try to read
the reply.  There is one observation when doing test, if i throttle write
speed to some extent, response can be successfully fetched. However, if i
speed up write speed, response will be lost most likely.

Hopely you can look at this when you have time ,Thanks.


Thanks.
Anty.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I think that's the correct behavior. If the side that receives the RST

</I>&gt;<i> application has successfully read the queued data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I suspect what you're seeing is OpenSSL behavior. It's likely reading

</I>&gt;<i> haven't had a chance to look at the OpenSSL code in question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In some cases OpenSSL will have to read ahead. It needs to receive the
</I>&gt;<i> complete SSL/TLS/DTLS record before processing it, for example; and if that
</I>&gt;<i> record is broken up into multiple TCP segments (because the path MTU is
</I>&gt;<i> smaller than the record size) then it could have a partial record when it
</I>&gt;<i> receives the RST. I can't tell if that situation is present in your case
</I>&gt;<i> (without manually decoding the tcpdump trace, which I don't have time to do
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment).
