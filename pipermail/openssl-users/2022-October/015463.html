<PRE>Hello all

Thank you for your replies. They are all helpful in their different ways,
but have missed one particular point I was looking to clarify.

Suppose I have two private keys: one for a CA named 'foo', and one for a
server, 'bar'. I am using `req` to produce a CSR *from* bar *to* foo, and
then using `ca` to have foo generate a certificate *for* bar. Both of these
commands can accept the `-config` and `-extensions` arguments. It seems to
me that the two configs used would be answering the same abstract
questions, but from the different perspectives of a cert requestor and a
cert issuer:

   - Who am I (the requestor)? / Who am I (the issuer)?
   Presumably this is handled by distinguished_name.
   - What kind of certificate do I want? / What kind of certificate am I
   willing to issue?
   Handled by req_extensions and/or x509_extensions?
   - For how long do I want the certificate to be valid? / For how long am
   I willing to make the certificate valid?
   Handled by default_days.
   - etc.

This is where the confusion begins: if &#8216;bar&#8217;, the certificate requestor,
itself wants to be a CA (basicConstraints = CA:true), then its bar.conf
must answer *both* sets of questions at the same time! I don&#8217;t see how this
is possible when the same sections and parameter names are used.

For instance, if bar wants to request its own CA certificate to be valid
for 5 years, but is only willing to issue others&#8217; certificates for 1 year,
what should `default_days` be in bar.conf? Generally, would bar&#8217;s `req`
section determine what bar itself wants to request, or how it processes the
requests of others? And since bar.conf has `basicConstraints = CA:true` to
request a CA certificate for itself, wouldn&#8217;t all the certificates it
issues also be CAs?

I fully expect my deductions above to be completely wrong because they
don&#8217;t make any sense, but I also do not understand how things *do* work,
and would greatly appreciate an explanation.


Best regards

</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Secondly, how is the absence of a configuration

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Thirdly, I would like to understand the difference between the

</I>&gt;<i> cipher would not be used in a CA.
</I>&gt;<i> I would guess Windows10 does not support SHA3?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Onto more practical concerns, I am thoroughly confused by how many
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; OpenSSL tools seemingly perform the same tasks. For example, one can
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, because the &quot;openssl&quot; tool is not really intended to be for
</I>&gt;<i> production.
</I>&gt;<i> It exists mostly to allow the libraries to be configured and tested.
</I>&gt;<i> So, it evolved based upon the need of the day, not any master design.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've argued for splitting much of the higher-layer functions that it does
</I>&gt;<i> into a different git repo, as the tool is too intimate with the libraries,
</I>&gt;<i> and the continue to be things you can't (easily) do programatically, but
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> tools do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Finally, if anyone happens to be in possession of an exhaustive
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; configuration file that includes *all* possible sections and fields
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; supported by OpenSSL, I would very much appreciate a copy!
