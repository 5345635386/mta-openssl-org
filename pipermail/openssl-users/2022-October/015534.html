</I>
Call SSL_read(). If it is app data it will be returned. If it is 
something else it will be handled.

&gt;<i> (2) Is the whole usage of OpenSSL even right for&#160;this scenario - maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> the structure and sequence of API&#160;calls should be rearranged somehow ?
</I>
Seems approximately right except that BIO_s_mem() is not a good choice 
for DTLS. It does not respect packet semantics, so if you receive 2 
packets and they both get pushed into the BIO_s_mem(), the reader will 
just get both packets together.

Unfortunately there is no equivalent of BIO_s_mem() that respects 
packets in 3.0/1.1.1. There is in the master branch (what will become 
3.2), where we have BIO_s_dgram_mem().

Also note that the only BIO that provides the various ctrls for querying 
the underlying MTU is BIO_s_dgram(). If you use something else that 
doesn't have those ctrls it will fallback to some worse case MTU.

It might be possible to write a custom BIO equivalent of BIO_s_mem() 
that does the right thing with respect to packets and has the right MTU 
ctrls.

On the server side you might want to consider whether DTLSv1_listen() 
should be used in your scenario, and whether you should set the cookie 
callback.

You should check the return value from SSL_do_handshake() and use 
SSL_get_error() to interpret any failure return codes.

&gt;<i> (3) There is an option to pass custom info_callback 
</I>&gt;<i> with&#160;SSL_CTX_set_info_callback(). Would there be a proper usage of 
</I>&gt;<i> this&#160;kind of callback in this scenario&#160;?
</I>
Not sure what you're asking here. There is a man page for this function 
here:
