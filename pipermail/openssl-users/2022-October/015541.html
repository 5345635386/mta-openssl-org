You don't have to remove the Cygwin version of perl, just change your PATH. This is basic both to the various shells available under Cygwin and to the Windows command line, so I'm getting the impression that you're not very familiar with your operating environment. That's not an ideal place to start from when trying to build, much less use, OpenSSL.

I can't be more detailed because at this point I frankly don't understand what you're trying to do. I suggest you try asking the right question, in a useful manner. (See <A HREF="https://catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions">https://catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions</A> for advice in how to ask the right question.)

In particular:

- Why are you trying to build OpenSSL?
- Why did you clone the GitHub repository rather than downloading one of the released source tarballs? Did you read the instructions on www.openssl.org on how to download OpenSSL source releases?
- What platform do you want to build OpenSSL for?
- What toolchain do you want to use, and if that's not the default toolchain for that platform, why aren't you using the default?
- Have you read the text files in the top-level directory of the OpenSSL source distribution?

There may well be an easier way to accomplish whatever your goal is. OpenSSL may not even be a particularly good solution for you. You haven't given us enough information to go on.

Up front, I'd like to apologize if this is an FAQ or has been answered elsewhere 
on this list: my workload means that I simply can't keep as up-to-date as I would 
like.

I have a situation where my application fails to accept an incoming SSL 
handshake on Windows Server 2012, but the identical software running on 
Server 2019 accepts the same connection from the same remote client without 
a problem. Other types of client software (such as Thunderbird) connect to 
either system without any problems. The connecting client is a Windows Cash 
Register using Window's built-in crypto facilities. If I downgrade my app to 
OpenSSL 1.1.1g or earlier, the problem doesn't happen. With 1.1.1k or 1.1.1q, I 
get the error (I haven't built any versions of OpenSSL between k and q). In case 
it helps, the connection is an incoming SMTP connection on port 587, and 
STARTTLS is used to begin SSL negotiation.

SSL_accept returns -1, with an extended error of &quot;SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL&quot; (5), 
which I understand to be largely what it returns when it doesn't have a clear idea 
of what's gone wrong. The error queue is completely empty in this situation. The 
cert is a LetsEncrypt cert that loads without errors and works fine with other 
clients.

Do recent versions of OpenSSL 1.1.1 have dependencies on some Windows 
facility (winsock and wincrypt seem likely candidates) that might work on Server 
2019 but fail on Server 2012?

The version of my application that is in public release uses 1.1.1g, so isn't 
affected by this issue, but I'm slightly worried that I'm going to see an uptick in 
this type of problem if I release builds based on later versions of 1.1.1.

Does this ring any bells with anyone? Again, apologies if this is answered 
elsewhere - I *did* spend some time in Google but couldn't find anything that 
seemed relevant.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Cheers!

Hi everyone,

I'm trying to enable fips provider in openssl3 by writing the following lines into openssl.cnf file:

openssl_conf = openssl_init

.include fipsmodule.cnf

[openssl_init]
providers = provider_sect

[provider_sect]
fips = fips_sect
base = base_sect

[base_sect]
activate = 1

Now when it is enabled, there is an error in syslog that libproviders.so file not found:

DSO support routines:dlfcn_load:could not load the shared library:crypto/dso/dso_dlfcn.c:118:filename(libproviders.so): libproviders.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
140666570000192:error:25070067:DSO support routines:DSO_load:could not load the shared library:crypto/dso/dso_lib.c:162:
140666570000192:error:0E07506E:configuration file routines:module_load_dso:error loading dso:crypto/conf/conf_mod.c:224:module=providers, path=providers
140666570000192:error:0E076071:configuration file routines:module_run:unknown module name:crypto/conf/conf_mod.c:165:module=providers

And this seems to be a common issue in openssl3. I have seen solutions like commenting out provider_sect but I think I would need it to enable fips provider. Is there any working solution for this?

Thank you,
Ashish
