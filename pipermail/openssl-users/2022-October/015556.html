I've taken a look at the captures for the working and non-working scenarios.

Do I understand correctly that your application is acting as the server 
in this setup?

I have compared the working and non-working captures. In both cases the 
ClientHello is successfully received, and the server responds with a 
ServerHello, Certificate, ServerKeyExchange and ServerHelloDone message. 
Aside from normal variations between one session and another, AFAICT, 
the ClientHello and the server's response messages all look identical 
other than the server obviously has a different Certificate. The 
Certificates themselves also look identical to each other other than the 
subject/subjectaltname being for a different server. The intermediate 
certs are the same in both cases.

Following the server's ServerHelloDone the client continues with a 
ClientKeyExchange message in the working case. In the non-working case 
the the client immediately closes the TCP connection without sending any 
kind of alert.

This really looks like a problem on the client side to me. Or at least 
that's where attention will have to be focused for now to figure out 
what went wrong. The client side has made the decision to close the 
connection (or plausibly some middlebox has, but this seems unlikely 
given that the handshakes up until that point look virtually identical).

Is there any possibility of getting any logs from the client side to see 
why it has decided to abort the connection?
