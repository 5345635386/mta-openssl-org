In defense of long term support distros, until a few years ago, no one 
suspected that OpenSSL would come under a new leadership that actively 
did everything to make it near-impossible to maintain backported 
security patches for a typical 5+ year distro lifecycle (with 
OpenSSL-independent start date).

Until 1.0.2, all OpenSSL releases were incremental patch-steps from the 
old 0.9.x series, allowing distro maintainers to manually cherry pick 
changes for doing ABI-compatible patches for whichever 1.0.x or 0.9.x 
was current at the start of their lifecycle.&#160; Then the new leadership 
started to restructure the code even in supposedly patch-level releases.

A lot of long term support distros are now firmly stuck with unsupported 
OpenSSL 1.0.2 and/or short life cycle 1.1.1.

Not all long term distros are run by rich companies like IBM/RedHat that 
can purchase support plans, resulting in further popularity of OpenSSL 
forks.

Enjoy
