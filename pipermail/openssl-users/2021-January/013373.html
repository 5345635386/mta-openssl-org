You are entirely correct.  I was surprised when I discovered this, but
there you go.  I suppose that the early implementation was &quot;on demand&quot;, 
i.e. RSA-PSS keys were seen out in the wild, prompting us (&quot;someone&quot;)
to add support for them.  RSA-OAEP keys haven't had the same demand,
so no one implemented support for them as such.

We do have support for RSA-OAEP, but only on an operational level,
i.e. encryption and decryption with a &quot;normal&quot; RSA key and additional
OAEP parameters for the operation.  On a command level, it means that
it's possible to have OAEP padding mode with 'openssl pkeyutl'.

A few of us in the team are keenly aware of the lack of RSA-OAEP key
support, and we have discussed internally whether we should add that
with OpenSSL 3.0...  I don't quite recall if we came to an actual &quot;yay
or nay&quot; decision, it's just not been a top priority item.  That being
said, I can't see that any of us will protest if someone chooses to
chip in and add such support, at least in our providers [*]

-----
[*] in other words, PR welcome...  I believe that the RSA-PSS work
    can be a good enough template that RSA-OAEP key support doesn't
    have to be too hard to do.

Cheers,
Richard
