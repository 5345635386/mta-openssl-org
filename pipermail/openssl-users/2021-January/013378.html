<PRE>&gt;<i> I'd welcome support for CBOR(-encoded) certificates since they can save a lot of space
</I>&gt;<i> for both the data itself and the code handling it, which may be vital for IoT scenarios, for instance.
</I>&gt;<i> It looks like the standardization of their definition got pretty far already.
</I>
Exactly! And there&#8217;s been a bunch of publications, describing/defining CBOR encoding for IoT certificates, such as 
<A HREF="http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1153958/FULLTEXT01.pdf">http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1153958/FULLTEXT01.pdf</A> 
 
&gt;<i> Although it is certainly possible to convert between DER-encoded ASN.1 (or at least its subset needed for X.509 certs) and CBOR,
</I>&gt;<i> this is not strictly needed since there is a definition of natively signed CBOR certs.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus all the ASN.1 fuzz, which is bulky and error-prone to implement and use, can be avoided then.
</I>
Yes. My primary goal is to reduce the overhead on the wire &#8211; but simplifying the processing code would be welcome as well.

&gt;<i> It may be also worth noting in this context that due to it sheer size the OpenSSL code itself is not suited for constrained systems.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet even then it would make sense if OpenSSL supported CBOR certs because they could be used by TLS peers on constrained systems.
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> Moreover, when using only natively signed CBOR certs it should be possible 
</I>&gt;<i> (though likely hard to achieve with the current strongly ASN.1 entangled libcrypto code)
</I>&gt;<i> to build OpenSSL without any ASN.1 support, which should reduce code size drastically.
</I>
Something I don't urgently need, but would welcome regardless.

&gt;<i> I suggest opening a feature request at <A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues</A>
</I>
Done: <A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/13925">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/13925</A> 

Thanks!

What do you mean &quot;specified&quot;? There's an ASN.1 &quot;specification&quot; of the certificate format, which theoretically can be encoded into whatever - DER, PER, OER, etc. One such tool (<A HREF="https://github.com/mouse07410/asn1c.git">https://github.com/mouse07410/asn1c.git</A> that I use) generates from ASN.1 file codecs for many encoding formats, and is able to convert between them.

Unfortunately, there's no ASN.1 -&gt; CBOR codec generator, AFAIK, which is why I'm asking here.

  The IETF internet-draft I reference is a way to do so, but it is (to repeat)
  very much a work in progress.
Understood. Do you know if there's any code behind it? Or just the &quot;theory&quot;?

Thanks!

I meant not &quot;CBOR protocol&quot; (which,  in all likelihood, doesn't and shouldn't exist) but CBOR encoding of X.509 certificates (which, hopefully, does exists).

At least, I'm looking for a tool that would convert between these two encodings (DER and CBOR) for specific objects (X.509-conformant certificates).

Thanks

No.  OpenSSL does not include any CBOR protocol support.
I'm also not sure what you mean by &quot;CBOR-encoded certificate&quot;; I don't
know of any such thing other than
<A HREF="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mattsson-cose-cbor-cert-compress/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mattsson-cose-cbor-cert-compress/</A>
which is very much still a work in progress.

Subject: Parsing and generating CBOR certificates?

I need to work with CBOR-encoded certificates. Is there any way to use OpenSSL to parse and/or generate certs in CBOR encoding?

Thanks

Regards,
Uri
