<PRE>I agree with Yannik that there is no compelling reason for&#160;
generally refusing to re-sign a non-self-signed certificate.

Correct that doing so, any existing AKID will need to be removed, or
better replaced.
BTW, the x509 app already contains code filtering out both AKID and SKID
extensions
when converting a certificate to a PKCS#10 CSR.
In that use case the self-signedness does make sense, and I suspect that
the restriction
on the input cert being self-signed historically stems from that use
case.

Can well be that there are further cert fields which also would require
some treatment,
but this is at the discretion of the new issuer,
and to this end some further support by the app would be nice but hard
to do generally.
(BTW, using a subject OU for expressing usage policies, as given
below&#160;as an example,
is anyway an abuse of that RDN field, and would be a good candidate for
removal.)
