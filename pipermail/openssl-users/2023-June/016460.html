<PRE>Answers below....

&gt;<i> 1) Is there a way to static link FIPS? I see at many places that fips 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be statically linked but would like to know if we have&#160;any 
</I>&gt;<i> other ways to do that.
</I>
No.&#160; This was a design goal/limitation from the start.&#160; Statically 
linking the FIPS provider would have been a major source of pain.&#160; We 
managed it for 1.0.2 with some inspirational assembly coding but that 
approach wouldn't have worked for 3.0.


&gt;<i> 2) If it is dynamic linking then does FIPS has any integrity check to 
</I>&gt;<i> make sure fips.so/fips.dll &lt;<A HREF="http://fips.so/fips.dll">http://fips.so/fips.dll</A>&gt; is the right one? 
</I>&gt;<i> and not some thing tampered by some body(as per my findings we have 
</I>&gt;<i> some check in configuration file as mentioned in the below attached 
</I>&gt;<i> snapshot 3rd line)
</I>
Yes it does do an integrity check on load. This was the main reason to 
limit the FIPS provider to being a loadable module.&#160; The approach taken 
in the 1.0.2 FOM wasn't viable with the re-architecture.


&gt;<i> 3) can both legacy and fips providers be loaded and used?
</I>
Technically yes, but you'll not be FIPS compliant unless you are 
*extremely* careful.
Which means talking to your FIPS labs and getting official resolutions 
on the specifics.
The OpenSSL developers are ***not*** FIPS experts.&#160; Only a FIPS lab can 
definitively answer questions like this.


&gt;<i> 4) Is it possible If i have built openssl with no-module configure 
</I>&gt;<i> option (to statically link legacy provider) and also wanted to use&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> openssl-3.0.8 built fips module here? If yes then in what way can it 
</I>&gt;<i> be done?
</I>
Honestly not sure here.&#160; You *must* load the FIPS provider dynamically 
to be compliant.
If that's possible with the no-module option, you should be okay.&#160; I 
suspect it isn't.&#160; Try it and see.

If you don't get a definitive result, this means talking to your FIPS 
labs and getting official resolutions on the specifics.

definitively answer questions like this.


&gt;<i> 5) Is it possible to load multiple&#160;providers like default, leacy and 
</I>&gt;<i> also fips programmatically using OSSL_PROVIDER_load&#160;function ?
</I>
Absolutely it is possible.&#160; However, meeting FIPS requirements 
afterwards could be problematic.
This means talking to your FIPS labs and getting official resolutions on 
the specifics.

Having several library contexts with each having different providers 
loaded might be a way to circumvent the strict interpretation of the 
requirements. This means talking to your FIPS labs and getting official 
resolutions on the specifics.

&gt;<i> 6) When multiple providers like for ex:&#160; FIPS and default provider are 
</I>&gt;<i> enabled and when an encryption function is called, then algorithm from 
</I>&gt;<i> which provider is picked(from my findings it can use any of the loaded 
</I>&gt;<i> provider implementations )? assumption that we have *not* used 
</I>&gt;<i> property query string during algorithm fetches to specify which 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation to be used.
</I>
The OpenSSL project *deliberately* makes *no guarantee* about which 
provider is used in such cases. It is deterministic currently, but there 
is no guarantee that we'll not change the order of resolution or making 
it randomly non-deterministic in any future releases.&#160; Honestly, expect 
that *we will* make changes to the resolution order in the future. Such 
a change is not considered breaking and doesn't have to adhere to our 
stable release policy.

Our best recommendation is to not mix providers in library contexts.&#160; 
Seek resolution from you FIPS lab.
