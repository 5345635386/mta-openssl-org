<PRE>&#8220;If certificates could be transmitted/stored in efficiently compressed (zipped) from,
theoretically one could save a couple of bytes by choosing as values

of low-entropy fields such as notBefore, notAfter, subject, and issuer

not only strings as short as possible, but also with a high portion of repeated chars,

such as

 

  Issuer: CN = 20010000000000efS
  Not Before: Nov 11 11:11:11 2023 GMT
  Not After : Nov 11 11:11:11 2025 GMT

&#8221;

Intentionally repeating characters in a hash is a great way to provide the hash to be broken. As I recall there is something about repeating a character more than 3 times consecutively that decreases the effectiveness of the hash. So the use of the series of zero&#8217;s and the repeated pattern &#8220;11:&#8221; are probably bad for hash security. I am unsure if that matters in this context however. 

 

Thanks,

Job

Subject: Re: Can create a cert with no serial number?

 

Probably could cut more if I put the DET (a specific IPv6 address) 

somehow into subject rather than SAN flagged critical.  

 

Generally, removing X.509v3 extensions helps save space, 

yet replacing a SAN with an IPv6 address by a subject DN entry

simulating the value, e.g., in the CN would be counterproductive
because the binary representation in the SAN is more efficient.
Here is an example (ab-)using OpenSSL test credential material:

 

openssl x509 -new -CA test/certs/server-ed25519-cert.pem \
 -set_serial 2 -CAkey test/certs/server-ed25519-key.pem \
 -force_pubkey test/certs/root-ed25519.pubkey.pem -subj / \
 -extfile &lt;(printf &quot;subjectAltName = IP:2001:3F:FE3F:F805:A93E:53B7:2709:E0BA\n 
                    subjectKeyIdentifier = none\n authorityKeyIdentifier = none&quot;) \
 -days 365 -outform der | wc | awk '{ print $3 }'
226
 
openssl x509 -new -CA test/certs/server-ed25519-cert.pem \
 -set_serial 2 -CAkey test/certs/server-ed25519-key.pem \
 -force_pubkey test/certs/root-ed25519.pubkey.pem \
 -subj &quot;/CN=20013FFE3FF805A93E53B72709E0BA&quot; \
 -extfile &lt;(printf &quot;subjectKeyIdentifier = none\n authorityKeyIdentifier = none&quot;) \
 -days 365 -outform der | wc | awk '{ print $3 }'
238

 

 

Unfortunately you cannot drop the rather inessential notBefore field,

and the coding restrictions in RFC 5280

disallow using a shortened (possibly even empty) string there.

 

If certificates could be transmitted/stored in efficiently compressed (zipped) from,
theoretically one could save a couple of bytes by choosing as values

of low-entropy fields such as notBefore, notAfter, subject, and issuer

not only strings as short as possible, but also with a high portion of repeated chars,

Well, I got the DER down to 240 bytes by dropping all the constraints.  

Probably could cut more if I put the DET (a specific IPv6 address)

this is what I have come up with.  This will replace what I currently 

have in draft-moskowitz-drip-dki

 

Use of this cert will rely on the DNS structure we will be creating for 

DRIP.  For example to find the issuing cert, the CN below maps to a 

specific FQDN that any DRIP compliant implementation will know to find.  

And if this cert is not found in the matching ip6.arpa. fqdn it has been 

revoked.  This cert is 2x the size of the DRIP specific RATS-styled 

Endorsement.  Implementers will be able to choose their poison.

The serial number is a defined field in the certificate structure.

It's not optional, so you can't get away from it.

 

In ASN.1 terms, it's an INTEGER.  In DER terms, the smallest possible

INTEGER occupies 3 bytes (one for the tag, which is 02, one for the

length 01, and one value byte in the decimal range -128..127 (80..7F)).

 

Without the serial number (just like without any other non-optional

field), whatever you happen to produce will not be a recognisable

X.509 certificate.

 

That's it.

 

Cheers,

Richard

         I tried putting in my conf:

         

         serial = none

         

         and that made an error.

         

         Best I have done is a serial of length 1 byte.  But in my work, the subject or SAN provide uniqueness and CRLs will not be used.  So want to see if I can create a cert with NO serial number.

         

         Thanks
