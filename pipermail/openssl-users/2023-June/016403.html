Hi Jochen,

While these points may be relevant in some environments, I don't think 
of them as enough reason to completely forbid users from cross-signing 
non-self-signed certificates.
Finally, this should be up to the user.

In our specific use case, it is us wanting to trust part of a third 
party pki, but restrict this trust by cross-signing with a name 
constraint. The third party may not be very interested in this (&quot;simply 
import our ca as is&quot;), but we want to do it, because internal pkis are 
not held to the same standard as public CAs which are bound by the 
CA/Browser Forum Baseline requirements.

Best regards
Yannik
