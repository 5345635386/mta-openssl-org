The only data you should be getting out of an `SSL_read` call is 
application data. If you're getting handshake or CCS messages as part of 
app data then something has gone very surprisingly wrong. I cannot 
imagine what would cause that.

You might want to open a github issue about that to dive into it in more 
detail.
