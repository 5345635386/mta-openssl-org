</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm inclined to agree. While there's an argument for backward
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compatibility,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C99 was standardized nearly a quarter of a century ago.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OpenSSL 1.x is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; younger than C99. It doesn't seem like an unreasonable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; requirement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Would this be a choice between backwards-compatibility with C90
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; compilers and compatibility with 32-bit architectures?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I don't see how.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It's a question of the C implementation, not the underlying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; architecture. A C implementation for a 32-bit system can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; certainly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; provide a 64-bit integer type. If that C implementation conforms
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; C99 or later, it ought to do so using long long and unsigned long
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; long. (I'm excluding C implementations for exotic systems where,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; example, CHAR_BIT != 8, such as some DSPs; those aren't going to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; viable targets for OpenSSL anyway.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there another way to get 64-bit integers on 32-bit systems?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Sure. There's a standard one, which is to include &lt;stdint.h&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; use int64_t and uint64_t. That also requires C99 or later and an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; implementation which provides those types; they're not required.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry. I assumed that it was clear from context that I was only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thinking about C90-compliant 64-bit integers on 32-bit systems.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; And for some implementations there are implementation-specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; extensions, which by definition are not standard.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; And you can roll your own. In a non-OO language like C, this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be intrusive for the parts of the source base that rely on a 64-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; bit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; integer type.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I suspect that that there are more 32-bit systems than there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; C90 compilers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Perhaps, but I don't think it's relevant here. In any case,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; OpenSSL is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; not in the business of supporting every platform and C
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; implementation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in existence. There are the platforms supported by the project,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; there are contributed platforms which are included in the code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; base
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and supported by the community (hopefully), and there are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; unsupported
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; platforms.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If someone wants OpenSSL on an unsupported platform, then it's up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; them to do the work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So it sounds like C90 is now officially unsupported.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I got the impression that, before this thread, it was believed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that C90 was supported, and the suggestion of a pull request
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; indicated a willingness to retain/return support for C90.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps it just indicated a willingness to accept community
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support for it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd be amazed if anyone could actually still be using a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 30 year old C90 compiler, rather than a compiler that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just gives warnings about C90. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding C90 compilers, it is important to realize that some system
</I>&gt;<i> vendors kept providing (arbitrarily extended) C90 compiler long after
</I>&gt;<i> 1999.&#160; Microsoft is one example, with many of their system compilers
</I>&gt;<i> for &quot;older&quot; OS versions being based on Microsoft's C90 compilers.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;These compilers did not provide a good stdint.h, but might be
</I>&gt;<i> coached
</I>&gt;<i> to load a porter provided stdint.h that maps int64_t and uint64_t to
</I>&gt;<i> their vendor specific C90 extensions (named __int64 and unsigned
</I>&gt;<i> __int64).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even worse, I seem to recall at least one of those compilers
</I>&gt;<i> miscompiling
</I>&gt;<i> 64 bit integer arithmetic, but working acceptably with the older
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL
</I>&gt;<i> 1.0.x library implementations of stuff like bignums (BN) and various
</I>&gt;<i> pure
</I>&gt;<i> C algorithm implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.x, that happened to do 
</I>&gt;<i> everything
</I>&gt;<i> by means of 32 and 16 bit types.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As part of our company business is to provide software for the
</I>&gt;<i> affected
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;older&quot; systems, thus desiring the ability to compile OpenSSL 3.x
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> options indicating &quot;compiler has no good integral types larger than
</I>&gt;<i> uint32_t, floating point is also problematic&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Other major vendors with somewhat old C compilers include a few
</I>&gt;<i> embedded
</I>&gt;<i> platforms such as older ARM and MIPS chips that were mass produced in
</I>&gt;<i> vast quantities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Performance wise, using a newer compiler that implements int64_t etc.
</I>&gt;<i> via
</I>&gt;<i> frequent library calls, while technically correct, is going to run
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessarily slow compared to having algorithms that actually use
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> optimal integral sizes for the hardware/compiler combination.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I seem to recall using at least one bignum library (not sure if
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL
</I>&gt;<i> or not) that could be configured to use uint32_t and uint16_t using
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> same C code that combines uint64_t and uint32_t on newer hardware.
</I>

That ship has sailed long long time ago. And it is NOT about the BIGNUM
type implementation which definitely supports native 32bit BN_WORD.
Although it might be possible to avoid using 'long long' or 'unsigned
long long' with some patching, the int64_t/uint64_t support is
absolutely required in other parts of OpenSSL than BIGNUM library and I
do not see any reasonable way to avoid it at all.

Yeah current OpenSSL library is definitely not a crypto library that
targets constrained 32 bit platforms that do not support 64 bit
integers.
