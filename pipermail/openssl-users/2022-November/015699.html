<PRE>Hi Job,
Thanks very much for your reply. Apologies for the lateness of mine.

I will ask around and get more information about Powershell and PDQ Inventory.

Thanks again,
Steven

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, I am running Windows 10, and since (unlike Linux) every piece
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of software outside of Windows itself needs to be updated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; individually, I don't know how to track down every single application that
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> might be using OpenSSL and make sure that the copy of OpenSSL it uses is
</I>&gt;<i> up-to-date.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You don't. There may be applications that have OpenSSL linked statically, or
</I>&gt;<i> linked into one of its own DLLs, or just with the OpenSSL DLLs renamed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As many of you would know, under repository-based systems (such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most Linux distros), this would not be an issue as I could update every
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> single application (system or non-system) at once.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is not true in the general case. There are applications which are
</I>&gt;<i> available on Linux which do not use the distribution's package manager.
</I>&gt;<i> There are applications which use their own OpenSSL build, possibly linked
</I>&gt;<i> statically or linked into one of their own shared objects or with the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL shared objects renamed. Linux distributions have not magically
</I>&gt;<i> solved the problem of keeping all software on the system current.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Back to Windows: It is possible, with relatively little effort, to find all
</I>&gt;<i> the copies of the OpenSSL DLLs under their usual names on a system, and then
</I>&gt;<i> glean from them their version information. With significantly more effort,
</I>&gt;<i> you can search for exported OpenSSL symbols within third-party binaries,
</I>&gt;<i> which will detect some more instances. With quite a lot of additional
</I>&gt;<i> effort, you can winkle out binaries which contain significant portions of
</I>&gt;<i> code matching some OpenSSL release (see various research efforts on
</I>&gt;<i> function-point and code-block matching, and compare with alignment
</I>&gt;<i> strategies in other fields, such as genomics). If your definition of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;OpenSSL in an application&quot; is not too ambitious, this might even be
</I>&gt;<i> feasible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But to what end? Each application will either be well-supported, in which
</I>&gt;<i> case you can find out from the vendor what OpenSSL version it contains and
</I>&gt;<i> whether an update is available; or it is not, in which you'll be out of
</I>&gt;<i> luck.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is true of essentially every software component, most of which are not
</I>&gt;<i> as well-maintained or monitored as OpenSSL. Modern software development is
</I>&gt;<i> mostly a haphazard hodgepodge of accumulating software of uncertain
</I>&gt;<i> provenance and little trustworthiness into enormous systems with
</I>&gt;<i> unpredictable behavior and failure modes. I'm not sure OpenSSL versions
</I>&gt;<i> should be particularly high on anyone's priority list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What are you actually trying to accomplish? What's your task? Your threat
</I>&gt;<i> model?
