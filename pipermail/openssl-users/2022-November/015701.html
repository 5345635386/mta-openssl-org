I'm pretty sure what Michael had in mind, is that you can have software 
that
runs on Linux that doesn't use system-provided OpenSSL (e,g. proprietary
software).

Well built distros, or even wll-built third party repos, will follow 
packaging
guidelines of a given distribution. And many distributions forbid 
distributing
copies of libraries that are already included in the distro proper.

So if you stick to software from official repositories, you should 
generally
be fine (unless you go for some very obscure and badly built distro).
  
&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure OpenSSL versions should be particularly high on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyone's priority list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand it, OpenSSL is responsible for establishing 
</I>&gt;<i> HTTPS connections, the primary protocol for ensuring security 
</I>&gt;<i> and authenticity over the Internet, and you *don't* think 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL versions should be a high priority? I don't understand 
</I>&gt;<i> your lack of alarm here.
</I>
Not necessarily, you can have an application using multiple cryptographic
libraries at the same time, but for different purposes.

Application built for Windows may well use schannel for establishing
HTTPS connections and OpenSSL for encrypting the local files.

Then a security vulnerability in OpenSSL's TLS implementation won't affect
the application.
