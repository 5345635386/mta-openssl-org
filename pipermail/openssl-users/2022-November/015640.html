</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see how.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a question of the C implementation, not the underlying
</I>&gt;<i> architecture. A C implementation for a 32-bit system can certainly
</I>&gt;<i> provide a 64-bit integer type. If that C implementation conforms to
</I>&gt;<i> C99 or later, it ought to do so using long long and unsigned long
</I>&gt;<i> long. (I'm excluding C implementations for exotic systems where, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, CHAR_BIT != 8, such as some DSPs; those aren't going to be
</I>&gt;<i> viable targets for OpenSSL anyway.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there another way to get 64-bit integers on 32-bit systems?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure. There's a standard one, which is to include &lt;stdint.h&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> use int64_t and uint64_t. That also requires C99 or later and an
</I>&gt;<i> implementation which provides those types; they're not required.
</I>
Sorry. I assumed that it was clear from context that I was only
thinking about C90-compliant 64-bit integers on 32-bit systems.

&gt;<i> And for some implementations there are implementation-specific
</I>&gt;<i> extensions, which by definition are not standard.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And you can roll your own. In a non-OO language like C, this would
</I>&gt;<i> be intrusive for the parts of the source base that rely on a 64-bit
</I>&gt;<i> integer type.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I suspect that that there are more 32-bit systems than there are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; C90 compilers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps, but I don't think it's relevant here. In any case, OpenSSL is
</I>&gt;<i> not in the business of supporting every platform and C implementation
</I>&gt;<i> in existence. There are the platforms supported by the project, and
</I>&gt;<i> there are contributed platforms which are included in the code base
</I>&gt;<i> and supported by the community (hopefully), and there are unsupported
</I>&gt;<i> platforms.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If someone wants OpenSSL on an unsupported platform, then it's up to
</I>&gt;<i> them to do the work.
</I>
So it sounds like C90 is now officially unsupported.
I got the impression that, before this thread, it was believed
that C90 was supported, and the suggestion of a pull request
indicated a willingness to retain/return support for C90.
Perhaps it just indicated a willingness to accept community
support for it.

I'd be amazed if anyone could actually still be using a
30 year old C90 compiler, rather than a compiler that
just gives warnings about C90. :-)
