<PRE>Thanks Viktor for the very good comments below.

Here is a more general side remark on a side info by Stephen Doody:

&gt;<i> For info we're running openssl version 1.0.2k-fips on Centos 7 in an AWS EC2 instance.
</I>OpenSSL 1.0.2 is heavily outdated.
Meanwhile, using anything below 3.0 is discouraged and imposes more or 
less security risks.

A further motivation for upgrading to a recent OpenSSL version is that 
the OpenSSL apps like x509
meanwhile have a significantly improved documentation and offer extended 
options for advanced use.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The command they suggested was:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> openssl pkey -in ourcert.pem -pubout -out pubkey1.pem
</I>&gt;<i> This extracts a bare public key from the first private key in the PEM

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The pubkey.pem file that is created only contains the public key and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing else, so the 3rd party service can no longer connect to our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system as it doesn't recognise this as a valid certificate and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complained that it was not trusted.
</I>&gt;<i> This makes no sense, because if they wanted a public key, they got one.
</I>&gt;<i> If they wanted a certificate, they should have asked for that, and not
</I>&gt;<i> given you incorrect instructions for getting just the key.  It seems
</I>&gt;<i> they need as much hand-holding as you do. :-(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've read through the man pages for pkey and x509 and I've also tried
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this: openssl x509 -in ourcert.pem -pubkey -out pubkey2.pem
</I>&gt;<i> This extracts two PEM objects, the &quot;bare&quot; public key *and* the
</I>&gt;<i> certificate (because you didn't also specify &quot;-noout&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And apparently, it was the certificate they were looking for after all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The 3rd party service can now connect to our system but viewing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> details of the pubkey2.pem file it looks identical to the original
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ourcert.pem file.
</I>&gt;<i> Almost identical, it wouldn't have your private key.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is pkey or x509 the right way to do this?
</I>&gt;<i> Apparently &quot;x509&quot;, and you don't need the &quot;-pubout&quot; option, that's not
</I>&gt;<i> what they meant to ask you for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it is pkey, how do I extract the public key so that it generates a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> valid certificate?
</I>&gt;<i> This makes no sense.  A public key is not a certificate, and does not
