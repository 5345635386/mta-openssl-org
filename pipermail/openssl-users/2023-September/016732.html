Perhaps walk you there step by step...

&gt;<i> We have a pem file that a colleague believes contains a private and a public key.

More likely, a private key and a (public key) X.509 certificate (a
certificate is basically a public key enclosed in a singed name binding
attestation).

&gt;<i> They want to extract the public key from the file and deploy that, so
</I>&gt;<i> a 3rd party service can access our system.
</I>
Typically, the 3rd party would want your certificate, though some are
sophisticated enough to directly use a &quot;bare&quot; public key.  The
distinction is important, so you need to check *precisely* what they're
looking for.

&gt;<i> The command they suggested was:
</I>&gt;<i> openssl pkey -in ourcert.pem -pubout -out pubkey1.pem
</I>
This extracts a bare public key from the first private key in the PEM
file.

&gt;<i> The pubkey.pem file that is created only contains the public key and
</I>&gt;<i> nothing else, so the 3rd party service can no longer connect to our
</I>&gt;<i> system as it doesn't recognise this as a valid certificate and
</I>&gt;<i> complained that it was not trusted.
</I>
This makes no sense, because if they wanted a public key, they got one.
If they wanted a certificate, they should have asked for that, and not
given you incorrect instructions for getting just the key.  It seems
they need as much hand-holding as you do. :-(

&gt;<i> I've read through the man pages for pkey and x509 and I've also tried
</I>&gt;<i> this: openssl x509 -in ourcert.pem -pubkey -out pubkey2.pem
</I>
This extracts two PEM objects, the &quot;bare&quot; public key *and* the
certificate (because you didn't also specify &quot;-noout&quot;).

And apparently, it was the certificate they were looking for after all.

&gt;<i> The 3rd party service can now connect to our system but viewing the
</I>&gt;<i> details of the pubkey2.pem file it looks identical to the original
</I>&gt;<i> ourcert.pem file.
</I>
Almost identical, it wouldn't have your private key.

&gt;<i> Is pkey or x509 the right way to do this?
</I>
Apparently &quot;x509&quot;, and you don't need the &quot;-pubout&quot; option, that's not
what they meant to ask you for.

&gt;<i> If it is pkey, how do I extract the public key so that it generates a
</I>&gt;<i> valid certificate?
</I>
This makes no sense.  A public key is not a certificate, and does not
contain one.  It is the other way around.
