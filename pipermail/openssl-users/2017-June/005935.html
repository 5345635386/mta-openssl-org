Aggregate traffic has a smooth profile, with daily increase towards the 
middle of the day, and decrease towards midnight. Client sessions are 
typically short (way under 1 minute, perhaps most of them under 15 
seconds).

I don't see any errors related to what you're saying.

&gt;<i> Or the clients have a really short timeout, or the connection's being

Well, I'm digging through the logs. The one thing I see often is:

     client X.Y.Z.K closed keepalive connection

Not much other than that, and these are really &quot;severity:info&quot; events, I 
see them even with TLS termination at the ALB.

I see some amount of...

     peer closed connection in SSL handshake while SSL handshaking

...also a &quot;severity:info&quot; event, at a rate about 4x less than the 
&#8220;inappropriate fallback&#8221; stuff.

(shrug) Seems normal.

As a more informal argument: We're using whatever Amazon deemed 
appropriate for their TLS policy for load balancers, in terms of 
protocol versions and ciphers. Surely if there was a problem with 
versions or ciphers, we'd hear about it, or they would change it 
quickly, just based on the amount of traffic they receive every day. 
That was the main reason why I've found hard to accept that this rate of 
TLS errors is somehow normal; but now I think I start to understand this 
aspect of the protocol thanks to the excellent explanations I've seen 
early in this discussion.
