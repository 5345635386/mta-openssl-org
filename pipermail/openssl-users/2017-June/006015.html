<PRE>Thanks Ben for all the replies and your comments. They are extremely useful
for my study

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Matt,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Could you help with following queries
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) On the blogpost for TLS1.3, you mentions the following in the session
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> section
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The specification recommends that applications only use a session once
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (although this is not enforced). For this reason some servers send multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> session messages to a client. To enforce the &#8220;use once&#8221; recommendation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applications could use SSL_CTX_remove_session() to mark a session as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-resumable (and remove it from the cache) once it has been used.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am a bit confused here as to why &quot;use once&quot; is recommended. How will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resumption be ensured then ? I get a PSK in first connection and use it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> again for all the other connections.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;use once&quot; is recommended in a limited circumstance, to prevent an
</I>&gt;<i> attacker listening on the network from associating the (multiple) resumed
</I>&gt;<i> sessions as being derived from the initial session.
</I>&gt;<i> This is a new possibility in TLS 1.3, since in TLS 1.2 the session ticket
</I>&gt;<i> was given to the client in cleartext (and presented back to the server in
</I>&gt;<i> cleartext), so all uses of the ticket were traceable back to the original
</I>&gt;<i> connection and linkable to each other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using a given ticket more than once in TLS 1.3 just brings things back to
</I>&gt;<i> basically the TLS 1.2 state in terms of linkability; it's not a
</I>&gt;<i> catastrophic failure or anything like that.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes Matt, when I switch to remote machines and test my application
</I>&gt;<i> programs, I see that TLS 1.3 is faster than TLS 1.2 in the first connection
</I>&gt;<i> (around same time as resumption time in TLS 1.2) itself and there is
</I>&gt;<i> marginal or no improvement in the subsequent connections even on using
</I>&gt;<i> resumption. Does this mean that resumption in TLS 1.3 is bringing not much
</I>&gt;<i> benefit in terms of latency. It makes sense because round trips count for
</I>&gt;<i> resumption or no resumption is 1 in TLS 1.3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only benefit with resumption is that the client can now send zero-RTT
</I>&gt;<i> data. (early data). However, if we consider the overall latency in
</I>&gt;<i> handshake, it is going to be the same equivalent to 1 round trip.
</I>&gt;<i> Is my understanding correct ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any way to enable early data or it gets activated by default once
</I>&gt;<i> the pre-shared keys are available at both the client and server ends ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No no no no no, many times no.
</I>&gt;<i> You really must not blindly enable early data without a proper protocol
</I>&gt;<i> analysis to determine what would happen if an attacker replayed the early
</I>&gt;<i> data millions of times, as is possible with the current TLS 1.3 draft
</I>&gt;<i> specification.  There are a lot of ways to hurt yourself and your users
</I>&gt;<i> with it, and I strongly recommend against trying to enable it just because
</I>&gt;<i> it looks faster.
</I>&gt;<i> (There are separate APIs from the normal read/write APIs to use early
</I>&gt;<i> data, to make you explicitly think about whether it's safe when adding
</I>&gt;<i> support to an application.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The comments give me much food for thought. I am still wondering on  on the
possibility for replay attacks when early data is enabled. Sorry, I am new
to OpenSSL or TLS and have so many doubts. So, I understood replay attacks
are possible as in early data enabled mode, data will go in the cleartext
form along with clientHello, so a middleman can look into the data and
replay it later. I was thinking if we use some kind of sequence number/
timestamps (as possible solution) to avoid this or it has been implemented
in OpenSSL ?
I am using the application for an internal project which is not going to be
public. So, I am wondering if it can be used. Nevertheless, your
recommendation is duly noted.


&gt;<i> I believe session resumption as a concept doesn't hold that much value
</I>&gt;<i> from TLS 1.3 onwards since 1-RTT is directly achieved in TLS 1.3 first
</I>&gt;<i> connection. Do you agree?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No.  Resumption saves on transferring (and validating!) certificates and
</I>&gt;<i> can be done without incurring the cost of an additional diffie-hellman
</I>&gt;<i> exchange, among other things.
</I>&gt;<i>
