Err, no, that's not correct. Server side caching is on by default.
Client side caching is off by default.

It should just work by default for TLSv1.3. You don't need to enable
anything.

&gt;<i> Also, I need a clarification on how does resumption work in case of
</I>&gt;<i> session identifiers if server side caching is not enabled
</I>
As noted above server side caching is on by default.

</I>
Just to be clear: you are using OpenSSL on both the server and client
sides right? If you are using something other than OpenSSL on the server
then the policy might be different around when the session information
is sent to the client (i.e. it could happen sometime later, or not at
all). If you are using OpenSSL on the server then it sends its session
information immediately after the main handshake has completed, so that
should not be a problem.

So if I understand you correctly the client is successfully creating a
TLSv1.3 connection, but the client side new session callback is never
being invoked? Did you call SSL_CTX_sess_set_new_cb() before or after
the SSL object itself was created? Are you able to share any code for
how you have done this?
