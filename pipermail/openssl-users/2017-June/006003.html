</I>
Care should also be taken about when you are starting your &quot;timer&quot; and
when you stop it, e.g. if you stop your timer after the session ticket
data has been received by the client then this is not a &quot;fair&quot; test (the
connection is ready for data transfer earlier than the arrival of the
session ticket).

I would expect to see the TLS1.3 latency for a full handshake to be
around the same as for a TLS1.2 resumption handshake. With a TLS1.3
resumption only marginally different. There are the same number of round
trips for a TLS1.3 full handshake as that there are for a resumption
one. The primary difference is that the Certificate message is not sent
(which can be quite a large message).

Your timings suggest you are testing this over a LAN where the effects
of network latency are going to be relatively low. The real benefits
from fewer round trips will really be seen when network latency is more
significant.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) PSK (Pre-shared keys) for resumption are highly emphasized in TLS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.3 RFC. How do we generate pre-shared keys in advance even without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making the first connection. Can someone guide me in the right direction.
</I>
As Ben says this is not currently supported in master but there is
pending WIP PR to add it.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The security properties of such &quot;external&quot; PSKs are substantially
</I>&gt;<i> different than the &quot;ephemeral&quot; PSKs used in resumption flows.
</I>
Ben - Even external PSKs incorporate an ephemeral, per connection, ECDHE
based secret (assuming a suitable kex_mode is used). What do you see as
the concern?
