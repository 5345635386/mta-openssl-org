I will run another test today and see if it is as easy as claimed to 
flag SAN critical.

I was wondering more the construction of the cert when 'no 
subjectName'.&#160; You confirmed that the object is there. Probably length 
0.&#160; I will have to look at that asnparse listing more critically.

&gt;<i>

</I>
Why I ask, perhaps seemingly dumb questions, here.&#160; Those that really 
know the stuff are still around.

I learned enough ASN1 to get by with x.509 and snmp and have forgotten 
much of what I learned ~20 years ago.&#160; I do have an iana enterprise 
number that I used in some of my OID proposals in both way back then.

The failing read access really bites.

thanks both of you.
