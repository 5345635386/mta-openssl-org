<PRE>@Andrew - Thanks for pointing that out. Indeed, that was the issue.

Hi,


&#160;


Your issue is not with BIO_read(), but with the differing signedness of the char type on your two platforms.


&#160;


On your PPC platform the char type defaults to unsigned, on your x86 platform it is signed.&#160; The %x format expects an unsigned int, so on x86 the
 signed char values are being sign-extended to int which adds the ffffff to any values where the high bit is set (i.e. seen as negative).


&#160;


One possible fix:&#160; Change &quot;char *ptr = buf;&quot; to &quot;unsigned char *ptr = buf;&quot;, then you should get the expected output.





Regards,


Andrew.

Subject: Does BIO_read() behave differently on diff architectures?




&#160;






Hi Experts,




&#160;




I am using openssl 1.0.2&#160;




&#160;




I recently moved my app from a PPC to x86 platform (application is compiled on the respective platform) where I met an issue with BIO_read().&#160;




&#160;




I read a 20bytes of data using BIO_read like following..




&#160;




int&#160; &#160; res = BIO_read(bio, buf, 20);




char *ptr = buf;




&#160;




The content that I send as input is a signed file content that I get from a different source. The issue is that the output 'buf' is not as expected on my x86. The behavior is different
 on different architectures.&#160;




&#160;




For e.g. on intel x86 platform I get the following output with additional 0xffffff padded.&gt;&gt; For me this is not the expected result.&#160;




22,ffffff82,2b,28,06,09,2a,ffffff86,48,ffffff86,fffffff7,0d,02,09,02,ffffffa0,ffffff82,3b,12,30




&#160;




This is what I was getting on my PPC platform which is as expected with the same app code.




22,82,2b,28,06,09,2a,86,48,86,f7,0d,02,09,02,a0,82,3b,12,30




&#160;




Ofcourse, I need to further check on the source where/how the signed file was generated, but does anyone have any idea if BIO_read() has any specific handling with repsect to architectures?.
 I'd rule out the endianess factor as I would expect the entire byte order to be reversed if so.&#160;




&#160;




I print the above output using the following code.&#160;







INFO( STR(&quot; ..&gt; Header@%02d: %02x,%02x,%02x,%02x,%02x,%02x,%02x,%02x,%02x,%02x,&quot;




&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &quot;%02x,%02x,%02x,%02x,%02x,%02x,%02x,%02x,%02x,%02x&quot;,




&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;ptr-buf, *(ptr+0),*(ptr+1),*(ptr+2),*(ptr+3),*(ptr+4),




&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; *(ptr+5),*(ptr+6),*(ptr+7),*(ptr+8),*(ptr+9),




&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; *(ptr+10),*(ptr+11),*(ptr+12),*(ptr+13),*(ptr+14),




&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; *(ptr+15),*(ptr+16),*(ptr+17),*(ptr+18),*(ptr+19)));&#160;




&#160;
