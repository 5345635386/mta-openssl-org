That isn't correct. pinshared is the default everywhere. The way it is achieved
is different for different platforms (so on Linux we use -znodelete).

Actually if all platforms behaved like Linux then there would be no need for
pinshared at all. Unfortunately they don't and on some platforms atexit handlers
can get called even after they have been unloaded - which obviously leads to
crashes.

Feasibly we could make no-pinshared the default on platforms where it isn't
really needed (such as Linux). However:

1) This introduces a change of OpenSSL behaviour based on platform - which isn't
ideal for application developers targeting multiple platforms. Not sure how big
a deal this is.

2) The no-pinshared option does not appear in 1.1.1 or 1.1.1a. It first appears
in 1.1.1b. Backporting the option was considered ok. But changing the default
mid-series is probably not a good idea.

Changing the default could be considered for 3.0.
