right out of the ld man page we see the option -R passed to the linker :

     -R path
     -rpath path

         A colon-separated list of directories  used  to  specify
         library  search  directories  to  the runtime linker. If
         present and not NULL, the path is recorded in the output
         object  file  and passed to the runtime linker. Multiple
         instances of this option are concatenated together  with
         each path separated by a colon. See Directories Searched
         by the Runtime Linker in Linker and Libraries Guide.

         The use of a runpath  within  an  associated  object  is
         preferable  to  setting  global  search  paths  such  as
         through the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment  variable.  Only
         the  runpaths  that  are  necessary  to find the objects
         dependencies should be recorded. ldd(1) can also be used
         to  discover  unused  runpaths  in dynamic objects, when
         used with the -U option.

         Various tokens can also be supplied with a runpath  that
         provide a flexible means of identifying system capabili-
         ties or an objects location. See Chapter 6, Establishing
         Dependencies  with  Dynamic String Tokens, in Linker and
         Libraries Guide. The $ORIGIN token is especially  useful
         in allowing dynamic objects to be relocated to different
         locations in the file system.


So that works. Alos there is a note about the dreaded :


     LD_LIBRARY_PATH

         A list  of  directories  in  which  to  search  for  the
         libraries specified using the -l option. Multiple direc-
         tories are separated by a colon.  In  the  most  general
         case,  this  environment variable contains two directory
         lists separated by a semicolon.

           dirlist1;dirlist2


         If ld is called with any number of occurrences of -L, as
         in:

           ld ... -Lpath1 ... -Lpathn ...


         then the search path ordering is:

           dirlist1 path1 ... pathn dirlist2 LIBPATH


         When the list of directories does not  contain  a  semi-
         colon, the list is interpreted as dirlist2.

         The LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment  variable  also  affects
         the runtime linkers search for dynamic dependencies.

         This environment variable can be specified with a _32 or
         _64   suffix.   This   makes  the  environment  variable
         specific, respectively, to 32-bit  or  64-bit  processes
         and  overrides  any non-suffixed version of the environ-
         ment variable that is in effect.


OKay good to know .. but ignore that for now.



     LD_OPTIONS

         A default set of options to  ld.  LD_OPTIONS  is  inter-
         preted by ld just as though its value had been placed on
         the command line, immediately following the name used to
         invoke ld, as in:

           ld $LD_OPTIONS ... other-arguments ...


OKay you need that.


     LD_RUN_PATH

         An alternative mechanism for specifying a runpath to the
         link-editor.  See the -R option. If both LD_RUN_PATH and
         the -R option are specified, -R supersedes.



Nice to know also.


So go back and recompile and set LD_RUN_PATH=/some/path/to/lib as well
as set LD_OPTIONS='-R/some/path/to/lib -L/some/path/to/lib ' and when
the link stage hits your output ELF files will have both a RUNPATH and
a RPATH set.  If you're using gcc you may also specify the option
-Wl,-rpath=/some/path/to/lib and you will get that passed to the linker.
