On any system with a shared library concept (perhaps except some
historic abominations), shared library unload reference counting
is already handled by the OS/loader.&#160; Thus any shared library that
cleans itself up when actually unloaded by the OS should just work.

Unfortunately OpenSSL 1.1.x chose to deliberately prevent itself
from being unloaded instead of making an internal abstraction for
the 3 unload scenarios common to all shared library systems:

A. Process is exiting, shared library is being unloaded along
 &#160; with the rest of the process.
 &#160; &#160;&#160; A few resources (such as network sockets and C FILE* objects)
 &#160; should be graciously cleaned up, memory will be freed unless the
 &#160; OS is &quot;no-MMU&quot; style (Linux-noMMU, Win32s).&#160; Any threads still
 &#160; accessing the library will exit very soon too.

B. Shared library is being unloaded before process exit was
 &#160; requested, all library resources must be cleaned up to avoid
 &#160; becoming memory leaks. No clients are trying to use the
 &#160; library, but any long-running library APIs might not have
 &#160; returned (due to application mistakes or lack of abort APIs).
Threads still accessing the library need to synchronize
 &#160; their orderly return to callers outside the shared library.
 &#160;&#160; If OS serialization allows, the library needs to delay
 &#160; completion of the unload handler until the threads have
 &#160; left the library.

C. A client application requests cleanup manually.&#160; Shared
 &#160; libraries accessed by multiple in-process &quot;applications&quot;
 &#160; (Your example above) will need to sometimes ignore such
 &#160; requests, static libraries can assume only one caller and
 &#160; should do the requested cleanup.

About 25 years ago I struggled with another library that did
the same kind of unload-blocking that OpenSSL 1.1.x does.&#160; It
was sad to see a big project like OpenSSL repeat that mistake.

Enjoy
