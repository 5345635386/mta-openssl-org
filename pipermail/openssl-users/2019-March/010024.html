const correctness is an ongoing thing. I'd welcome PRs that address this.

&gt;<i>  * Signed vs. unsigned values for integer values
</I>
We did do quite a bit of work internally in libssl to implement more consistent
use of size_t where appropriate. We need to do something similar in libcrypto
although that's probably a much bigger job. Dealing with things internally is
much easier than changing the API - because that is obviously a breaking change
which we try to avoid where possible.

</I>
I would hope that we're not introducing any new instances of this. Any that we
have are likely to be historical. Removing such instances would be a matter of
deprecating the relevant APIs and making sure they have suitable portable
replacements in place.

&gt;<i>  * Possibly using something like uint8_t* for pointers to buffers

I'd be in favour of that for SSL_ctrl/SSL_CTX_ctrl where I don't think the
&quot;ctrl&quot; pattern adds much value. All SSL_METHOD implementations share the same
ctrl implementation, with the exception of DTLS which adds a few extra ctrls.

For other areas that may not be the case. For example with BIO_ctrl all the
different BIO_METHODs all have quite separate ctrl implementations so there
seems a bigger benefit to this pattern there.
