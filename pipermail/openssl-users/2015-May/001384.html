<PRE>If you don't know about list comprehension in Python, you can simply
construct a list in a loop to get the job done.  The end result is the same
no matter which approach you take.

The same is not true for cryptography.  While Sec_Aficionado is quite
eloquent and makes several valid points, I think his overall argument does
not hold water.  I have audited the crypto implementations in a number of
open-source projects over the years found wide variance in their quality.
In one instance a popular piece of software included a feature which
claimed to encrypt its data using AES-256.  It turned out that the code
copied the user's password directly into the key buffer, either padding
with null bytes or truncating depending on the length.  The data was then
encrypted using AES-256 in ECB mode.  The software's primary purpose was
not cryptography, and it provided innovative and creative features
otherwise.  This type of bug is insidious, since it doesn't really protect
the data in any meaningful way and lulls its users into a false sense of
security.

I am not advocating that the realm of information security be forever
relegated to a select few.  That is also dangerous, as Sec_Aficionado
correctly pointed out.  However, the study of cryptography should never be
undertaken without the guidance of an experienced practitioner.  I had the
extraordinary opportunity to study information security at university under
the guidance of an ex-NSA analyst.  I recognize that I am extremely lucky
to have had this chance, and that this kind of education is only available
to a select set of people worldwide.  I also don't have a solution to the
problem of training the next generation of cryptographers.  However, having
yet another potentially compromised AES implementation written by a novice
programmer is not something that I want to encourage.
