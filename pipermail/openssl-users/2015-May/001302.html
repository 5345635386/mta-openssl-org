Yes. You can see the following exchanges in the traces:

Client                    Server
------                    ------

ClientHello ------------&gt;
                          ServerHello
                          Certificate
                          CertificateRequest
            &lt;------------ ServerHelloDone
Certificate
ClientKeyExchange
CertificateVerify
ChangeCipherSpec
[Finished (Encrypted)] --&gt;
            &lt;------------ Alert (Decrypt Error)

If I understand your setup correctly (I'm not familiar with Janus or
WebRTC), Janus is acting as the client here and WebRTC is the server,
and both are using OpenSSL?

</I>
The server doesn't like something the Client sent in the last flight of
messages, i.e. the Certificate, ClientKeyExchange, CertificateVerify,
ChangeCipherSpec or Finished. It's unlikely to be the Certificate as, as
far as I can tell, its the same Certificate in the &quot;good&quot; exchange
versus the bad. So that means either the ClientKeyExchange,
CertificateVerify or Finished messages (CCS is super simple so I don't
think its that).

Is WebRTC using 1.0.1 too (and if so which letter version)? Looking at
the 1.0.1 code there are only a few places where a decrypt error can
come from. Possible causes (in 1.0.1 code base):

- digest check failed processing the Finished message
- CRL signature failure processing the client Certificate
- Bad RSA decrypt processing the CertificateVerify
- Bad RSA signature processing the CertificateVerify

There are a few other places that emit Decrypt Error alerts but none of
them seem to apply here. Getting some additional logging might help us
figure out which one of these is the cause.

These are all quite low level issues though...deep in OpenSSL internals.

Matt
