<PRE>So can I assume the FIPS POST has completed if I never call FIPS_mode_set() in the code?  I was confused about that.

When we call SSL_read() and get a 0 byte return we call SSL_get_error() to see if there was an error not not.  Maybe there is a more efficient handle this, like looking at the shutdown flag?

       0   The read operation was not successful. The reason may either be a
           clean shutdown due to a &quot;close notify&quot; alert sent by the peer (in
           which case the SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN flag in the ssl shutdown state
           is set (see SSL_shutdown(3), SSL_set_shutdown(3)). It is also
           possible, that the peer simply shut down the underlying transport
           and the shutdown is incomplete. Call SSL_get_error() with the
           return value ret to find out, whether an error occurred or the
           connection was shut down cleanly (SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN).

When we call SSL_accept we also call SSL_get_error() to see we need to read or write.  Is there a more efficient way to tell if we need to read or write?

       If the underlying BIO is non-blocking, SSL_accept() will also return
       when the underlying BIO could not satisfy the needs of SSL_accept() to
       continue the handshake, indicating the problem by the return value -1.
       In this case a call to SSL_get_error() with the return value of
       SSL_accept() will yield SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE.
       The calling process then must repeat the call after taking appropriate
       action to satisfy the needs of SSL_accept().  The action depends on the
       underlying BIO. When using a non-blocking socket, nothing is to be
       done, but select() can be used to check for the required condition.
       When using a buffering BIO, like a BIO pair, data must be written into
       or retrieved out of the BIO before being able to continue.


Thank you...

</I>&gt;<i> Lock #1 is CRYPTO_LOCK_ERR, which I believe is used for logging errors.  It appears your application is generating a lot of errors for some reason.  Never tried it myself, but you probably can't disable this lock with multiple threads running.  You should take a look at the error log to identify the cause of the errors.  Then resolve the issue, whatever it may be.
