</I>&gt;<i> After some digging, it looks like ''VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary

</I>&gt;<i> Does the chain override the root or anchor? I think RFC 4518 treats

This was fixed in the git 1.0.2 HEAD a little while ago. If you try that
version it should work, and will be in 1.0.2b.

A backport of the fix also exists for 1.0.1 but it hasn't hit the repo yet.
