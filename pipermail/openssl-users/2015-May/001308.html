Can you confirm that the trace you attached for the correct negotiation
also came from Janus? I spotted some odd things about the extensions in
the ClientHello:

It has the &quot;extended master secret&quot; extension. That extension is not
supported by any released version of OpenSSL (we have it in the dev
version of 1.1.0 - but that is unreleased).

It correctly adds the ec_point_formats and elliptic_curves extensions.
However it so happens that OpenSSL 1.0.1f has a bug in it (not in the
latest version) which suppresses those extensions for DTLS (this is a
significant enough bug in itself that it is worthwhile upgrading your
OpenSSL)

OpenSSL always adds extensions in the same order - and these extensions
are in a different order.

Due to the above it looks to me like the OpenSSL DTLS stack was not used
to generate that ClientHello. The failed one *does* look like an OpenSSL
generated ClientHello.
