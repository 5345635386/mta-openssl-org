<PRE>Hi, all...

I think it wise to go back to the OP's stated objective, to create &quot;an 
independent to libraries source code for demonstration purposes for 
AES-CTR mode.&quot; The operative prepositional phrase here being &quot;for 
demonstration purposes.&quot;

Thus, whether it is wise to implement one's own crypto 
library/engine/etc. in *production*, I see no particular reason why 
learning from creating one as a demonstration or proof of concept (and 
even providing such code here or elsewhere for critique) is such a bad 
thing.

This list is replete with experienced practitioners. If this isn't a 
good place to critique such a demonstration or proof of concept, perhaps 
someone here knows of a better list (one perhaps not focused on using 
OpenSSL in particular, say crypto.stackexchange.com - adn that is not an 
endorsement, merely an example).

</I>&gt;<i> The same is not true for cryptography.  While Sec_Aficionado is quite 
</I>&gt;<i> eloquent and makes several valid points, I think his overall argument 
</I>&gt;<i> does not hold water.  I have audited the crypto implementations in a 
</I>&gt;<i> number of open-source projects over the years found wide variance in 
</I>&gt;<i> their quality.  In one instance a popular piece of software included a 
</I>&gt;<i> feature which claimed to encrypt its data using AES-256.  It turned 
</I>&gt;<i> out that the code copied the user's password directly into the key 
</I>&gt;<i> buffer, either padding with null bytes or truncating depending on the 
</I>&gt;<i> length.  The data was then encrypted using AES-256 in ECB mode.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> software's primary purpose was not cryptography, and it provided 
</I>&gt;<i> innovative and creative features otherwise.  This type of bug is 
</I>&gt;<i> insidious, since it doesn't really protect the data in any meaningful 
</I>&gt;<i> way and lulls its users into a false sense of security.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not advocating that the realm of information security be forever 
</I>&gt;<i> relegated to a select few.  That is also dangerous, as Sec_Aficionado 
</I>&gt;<i> correctly pointed out.  However, the study of cryptography should 
</I>&gt;<i> never be undertaken without the guidance of an experienced 
</I>&gt;<i> practitioner.  I had the extraordinary opportunity to study 
</I>&gt;<i> information security at university under the guidance of an ex-NSA 
</I>&gt;<i> analyst.  I recognize that I am extremely lucky to have had this 
</I>&gt;<i> chance, and that this kind of education is only available to a select 
</I>&gt;<i> set of people worldwide.  I also don't have a solution to the problem 
</I>&gt;<i> of training the next generation of cryptographers. However, having yet 
</I>&gt;<i> another potentially compromised AES implementation written by a novice 
</I>&gt;<i> programmer is not something that I want to encourage.

</I>&gt;<i>     While implementing one's own security and/or cryptography is

</I>&gt;<i>     programmers), creating cipher implementations from scratch is
</I>&gt;<i>     probably one of the best ways to learn and understand the
</I>&gt;<i>     intricacies of the problem at hand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Learning about the pitfalls and advantages of the algorithms is
</I>&gt;<i>     key for a future security expert. Moreover, denying someone access
</I>&gt;<i>     to help on an open source project is antithetical to the OSS
</I>&gt;<i>     philosophy. How can anyone hope to understand code that by its
</I>&gt;<i>     very nature is cryptic and complex if there's no one willing to
</I>&gt;<i>     help disentangle, at least at a high level, the routines and
</I>&gt;<i>     functions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     InfoSec is a black art today, but it needs to get out of that
</I>&gt;<i>     mode. After the last few years it is clear that unless we open up
</I>&gt;<i>     the understanding of these disciplines, we will be at the mercy of
</I>&gt;<i>     experts with hidden agendas. Only educated users can hope to make
</I>&gt;<i>     correct use of cryptography, or be able to choose the best
</I>&gt;<i>     application for their needs. As we know, even a robust cipher is
</I>&gt;<i>     useless if utilized for the wrong purpose or poorly configured. We
</I>&gt;<i>     can't turn away those with a genuine interest in learning how to
</I>&gt;<i>     use cryptography without dooming ourselves to continue with the
</I>&gt;<i>     status quo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I appeal to those of you who routinely share your knowledge and
</I>&gt;<i>     try to make a difference here, that you provide some guidance and
</I>&gt;<i>     not turn away people with basic questions like this one. These are
</I>&gt;<i>     the users who may become one day contributors. They should be
</I>&gt;<i>     nurtured and not shunned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     OK, I'll get off my soapbox now. Have a great week everyone.
