<PRE>Hi Matt,

Thanks so much for the quick and thorough response.&#160; I had caught bits
and pieces of the algorithm selection process while going through the
design doc but apparently didn't catch just how flexible it really is.&#160;

As for the 140 level of testing, that's just what we expected.

Thanks again,
Pete

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have two questions regarding support for FIPS in 3.0.&#160; We're currently working on early planning for our migration to OpenSSL 3.0 and we're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying to size the effort for our team.&#160; We're also beginning to put together contingency plans in the event that dates on either side change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dramatically.&#160; I suspect I already know the answers to these questions, but I wanted to ask just to be sure so that we plan correctly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Over the years we have had requirements to include additional functionality within our FIPS boundary beyond what was in the OpenSSL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based FOM.&#160; We would start with the existing OpenSSL FOM, add in the additional functionality, and then go through a full validation with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> test lab on this slightly modified FOM.&#160; We had the impression that there are other groups that do the same.&#160; An example of additional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functionality, especially for the 3.0 FOM, might be something like the SSH KDF.&#160; If this KDF were to not be included in the 3.0 FOM and we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needed a FIPS validated version of it in our solutions, we would need to move this into the FIPS provider and then take this altered FOM through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a complete FIPS validation.&#160; If however, we were to create a 3rd party provider that only contains this supplemental FIPS functionality, we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could go through an abbreviated FIPS validation of just that functionality and then have both the OpenSSL 3.0 FOM and this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supplemental FOM active at the sa,me time in our solution.&#160; So the question is, will the OpenSSL 3.0 design allow for more than one active
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> FIPS provider?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is possible. As far as end applications are concerned FIPS
</I>&gt;<i> validated algorithms must be &quot;fetched&quot;. Applications can either do this
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly or implicitly. If done explicitly then you must specify the
</I>&gt;<i> name of the algorithm you wish to use, and a property query string. If
</I>&gt;<i> done implicitly then the same thing happens inside libcrypto. The name
</I>&gt;<i> of the algorithm is inferred, and a default property query string is
</I>&gt;<i> used (which can be set through a config file).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All algorithms that exist within the FIPS provider use the property
</I>&gt;<i> string &quot;fips=yes&quot;. So if you only want to use FIPS validated algorithms
</I>&gt;<i> then you just set that query string to be the default - or specify that
</I>&gt;<i> query string explicitly if doing explicit fetching.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is nothing to stop you from having a second FIPS provider loaded
</I>&gt;<i> with different algorithms in it. As long as you specify all the
</I>&gt;<i> algorithms in that provider to have &quot;fips=yes&quot; against them, then it
</I>&gt;<i> will appear the same as any other FIPS validated algorithm to an end
</I>&gt;<i> application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another way end applications can arrange things is to forget about
</I>&gt;<i> property strings and only ever have the FIPS provider(s) loaded (ie. do
</I>&gt;<i> not load the default provider). This means all algorithms will come from
</I>&gt;<i> the FIPS providers. Again there is nothing to stop you from having
</I>&gt;<i> multiple of these.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've made a pass through the 3.0 design specification looking specifically at FIPS provider related content but did not see an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explicit statement that there can only be one FIPS provider, although, I suspect this is the case and wanted to confirm this.&#160; If it's at all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible to have two active FIPS provider, it could make subsequent FIPS validations simpler.&#160; On the other hand, am I completely missing some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fundamental aspect of FIPS provider functionality in 3.0 and this need to add additional support into the FOM will not be as involved as it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> used to be?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The second question is somewhat related.&#160; Has there been a decision yet whether the FOM 3.0 will go through a 140-2 or a 140-3 validation?
</I>&gt;<i> We are going through 140-2.
