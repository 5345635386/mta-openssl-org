</I>Depends heavily if you formally interpret a self-signed and self-issued
end cert as a CA issuing itself (thus requiring CA:TRUE and making it
invalid as an end cert) or as an end cert with no separate CA chain
(thus requiring CA:FALSE and making it not trusted as a CA for any other
certificate).

Either way, the typical case is to use such a self-signed and self-issued
cert in the various OpenSSL supported protocols (SSL, TLS, CMS etc.)
&gt;<i> However, that said:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> openssl verify ./ca.crt
</I>&gt;<i> This command verifies the certificate in question by trying to find in
</I>&gt;<i> the default store a chain of issuers leading up to a trust anchor
</I>&gt;<i> (typically a self-signed root CA).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But a self-signed certificate is self-issued, so unless it is itself
</I>&gt;<i> present in the trust store, no possible issuer can be found there.  So
</I>&gt;<i> verification must always fail, and so it does.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> why I'm getting this error?
</I>&gt;<i> Well ultimately because you don't know what you're trying to do,
</I>&gt;<i> but specifically because the certificate is not issued by an
</I>&gt;<i> already trusted issuer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is this an expected behavior in OpenSSL 1.1.1?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
