<PRE>Thanks Victor.

I need to look at X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() a little closer, but I think I understand what I need to do.

I also can't concatenate all my trusted certificates into a single file, there are dozens of certificates in the trusted store. Our users can also manipulate the trusted store, so the trusted certificates will always be in PEM files in /etc/ssl/certs/.

It sounds like that's not going to hold me back from accomplishing what I need to do though, but I'll pursue this and let the list know if I run into any other issues.

Thanks again,

Jason

The verify callback is mostly for logging and error reporting.  It is
not intended to supplant the built-in verification logic.  While it
can be used to ignore some errors, that's generally quite risky and
difficult to do correctly.  You should strive to arrange for the
built-in verification to succeed, rather than attempt to work around
the resulting errors when it does not.

&gt;<i> I set up an X509_STORE object and then cycle through all of the

</I>&gt;<i> PEM_read_X509() to get an X509 (certificate) object and then call
</I>&gt;<i> X509_STORE_add_cert(x509_stor, certificate) to read the certificates
</I>&gt;<i> into  my trusted store, X509_store object.
</I>
It would be far simpler to concatenate them into a single CAfile, or use
&quot;c_rehash&quot; to create the symlinks need to make the directory into a
workable CApath.  You should not have to manually load them into your
own store, although doing the latter potentially gives you the
opportunity to decorate them with auxiliary trust EKUs.


&gt;<i> If the user of this CTX is acting as a client and the server presents
</I>&gt;<i> a certificate chain, and my trusted store has the root, the connection
</I>&gt;<i> will work, as the chain is verified and trusted.
</I>
With the partial chain flag it can also work when the EE cert is present
(verbatim) in the store, or an intermediate CA is present in the store.

&gt;<i> If the server presents a self-signed certificate, the
</I>&gt;<i> verify_callback() function is invoked with the error
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 18/X509_V_ERR_DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT, but if I search for and find the self-signed cert in my trusted store, I clear the error and let the
</I>&gt;<i> connection proceed.
</I>
With 1.0.2 and later, the partial chain flag makes this work-around
unnecessary.

&gt;<i> The scenario is very similar for the case I asked about, the only difference is I'm presented a 2 certs in a chain, and I have the
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate cert in my store.  My understanding was the verify_callback() is the correct place to handle these cases.
</I>
No, it is not.

&gt;<i> From Victor's response, I don't know what a custom X509_STORE type is
</I>&gt;<i> or how to set one up.
</I>
You're already populating a custom store (though not a store type, which
it does not look like you need since your store is just a directory full
of PEM files).

&gt;<i> Likewise, I don't know how to use the &quot;partial chain&quot; flag
</I>
See X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags(3).

&gt;<i> and what API I need to load intermediate certificates into my trusted
</I>&gt;<i> store(other than what I describe above). Because of the way
</I>&gt;<i> certificates are distributed, I can't always rely on having the root
</I>&gt;<i> in the trusted store, so I'll need to trust some intermediate certs,
</I>&gt;<i> provided they are valid, actually signed the end-entity cert, etc.
</I>
You just need to add them to the store, simplest is a CAfile or
a hashed CApath.
