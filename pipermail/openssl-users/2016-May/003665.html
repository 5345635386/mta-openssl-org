<PRE>We've had a PayPal account for years, as the most convenient way for
individuals to send small donations. However, as the person who has
managed that account I can attest that PayPal has always been rather
annoying to deal with, and I've finally hit my limit. I'm in the process
of closing that account (something PayPal makes unnecessarily difficult
and protracted). I was able to refund most of the recent donations that
we were unable to recover, leaving a balance of $259.45 that will either
be forfeited to PayPal or (hopefully) refunded by them back to the
original donors.

The PayPal donate link (&quot;button&quot;) on our web site has been removed. I've
asked PayPal to block any future inbound transactions while we fight
over the account closure, but can't be confident that was done. Please
do not donate via PayPal to any account claiming to represent us; such
donations won't go to us and may not ever be returned to you.

This closure of the only convenient means of receiving small donations
does not mean that we do not value such donations. Those of you who have
donated via PayPal, many via recurring donations, have our gratitude and
thanks. I regret that there is no clear alternative to switch to instead
(suggestions welcome if there are options I'm unaware of).

-Steve M.
