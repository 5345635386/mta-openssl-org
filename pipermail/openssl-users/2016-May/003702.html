State taxation isn't a problem; OpenSSL Software Foundation is
incorporated in Delaware which has no tax. U.S. tax deductibility is
largely irrelevant to our donors, most of which are outside the U.S.

Be my guest and go for it, but I do have a good idea if it would yield
anything meaningful because I've been working this issue in detail for a
couple of years now. Our attorneys (we've checked with several, and with
ones experienced with 501(c)) don't see a viable path worth the
substantial investment it would cost us.
