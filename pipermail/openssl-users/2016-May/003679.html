Personal bank accounts, yes. But, we don't want to entangle OpenSSL
funds with any team members personal finances. Those funds need to be
held by an independent OpenSSL legal entity (of which there are already
several). Also keep in mind that most of my colleagues are hardcore
geeks best suited to wrangling OpenSSL code. I try to handle as many
paperwork hassles as possible to free them for that more important activity.

As for setting up &quot;an independent legal entity&quot;, we have engaged a
number of (expensive) accountants and attorneys to that end, and along
the way have created two non-U.S. legal entities. The bank account(s)
those entities would need to be of any value have proven to be the
bigger challenge.

The issue is still being actively worked, and I'm sure we'll solve it
eventually. I initially (as someone who has created multiple U.S.
companies) thought it would be as easy as you assume. It's been an
education.
