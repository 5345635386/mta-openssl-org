After another half hour of &quot;your call is important to us&quot; recordings, I
have apparently succeeded in closing our PayPal account. I was promised
that the 29 donations totaling $258.48 that I was unable to either
withdraw or refund will be refunded directly by PayPal.

Thanks again to all the donors who have support OpenSSL, via PayPal or
other means. I'm looking into alternatives for account free online
payments, so far without success.
