<PRE>Hello,

</I>&gt;<i> original donors.

</I>&gt;<i> The PayPal donate link (&quot;button&quot;) on our web site has been removed. I've

</I>&gt;<i> over the account closure, but can't be confident that was done. Please
</I>&gt;<i> do not donate via PayPal to any account claiming to represent us; such
</I>&gt;<i> donations won't go to us and may not ever be returned to you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This closure of the only convenient means of receiving small donations
</I>&gt;<i> does not mean that we do not value such donations. Those of you who have
</I>&gt;<i> donated via PayPal, many via recurring donations, have our gratitude and

</I>&gt;<i> (suggestions welcome if there are options I'm unaware of).

I do hope an excellent solution can be found.

Apologies in advance for this probably going off topic.

Steve, could you possibly provide any details of how Paypal
caused you to &quot;finally hit your limit&quot; ?
(your blog would be great)

I am sure I am not the only curious person reading this ;)

Many Thanks
