</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Isn't it conceivable to ask one of the European payment service provider to

</I>&gt;<i> In my role as the OpenSSL beancounter I've run into a more general issue

</I>&gt;<i> outside the U.S. and is spent outside the U.S., and really shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> need to reside in or even transit through the U.S. But, since I'm
</I>&gt;<i> American and know that country best that's where I set up the OpenSSL
</I>&gt;<i> legal entities and bank accounts years ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been trying unsuccessfully to transition our funding to a non-U.S.
</I>&gt;<i> bank for some time. But, we're an unusual organization (banks don't like
</I>&gt;<i> unusual) and I also am operating under a severe handicap known as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;FATCA&quot;, the TL;DR of which being that when a bank sees I'm calling from
</I>&gt;<i> a U.S. number and speaking with an obvious U.S. accent they can't
</I>&gt;<i> dismiss me fast enough, usually before I get the chance to emphasize
</I>&gt;<i> that no &quot;U.S. person&quot; needs to have signature authority for the account.
</I>&gt;<i> I've been through this drill with dozens of banks, from Estonia to
</I>&gt;<i> Singapore. We've gotten as far as opening an account with an initial
</I>&gt;<i> deposit, only to have that bank close the account for unspecified
</I>&gt;<i> reasons a week later. I've spent an unbelievable amount of time on this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there is a non-U.S. bank willing to have OpenSSL as a customer I'd
</I>&gt;<i> love to talk to them. We've even created non-U.S. corporate entities (in
</I>&gt;<i> IoM and BVI) for that purpose; after many months they remain bankless.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Consider having the non-U.S. person do the account setup too.

Banks are as scared of US jurisdiction as crypto engineers.

Enjoy
