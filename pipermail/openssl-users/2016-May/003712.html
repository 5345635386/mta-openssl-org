AIUI, the reason for that is solely that they cannot agree to make any 
payments that could be considered to be illegal. This is for obvious 
reasons; other than that, SPI does not set any rules on what member 
projects choose to do with their funds:

   &quot;Member projects are free to use the funds allocated to them at their
    descretion, as long as such usage is consistent with U.S. laws and
    regulations, and within the constraints of SPI's certificate of
    incorporation and bylaws&quot;

(from <A HREF="http://spi-inc.org/donations/">http://spi-inc.org/donations/</A>)

The certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not seem to impose any 
further restrictions--but don't take my word for it (they're both 
available on their website).

&gt;<i> We would have to trust their good judgment in deciding
</I>&gt;<i> how those funds were used.
</I>
Actually, as a member project, you would gain the right to vote or stand 
for election in SPI's internal elections, and in doing so would be able 
to exert influence over SPI's decisions.
