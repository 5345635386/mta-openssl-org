</I>
That is definitely true, which is how I was able to get our local U.S.
bank here to allow signature access to our accounts by non-U.S.
colleagues. It's important that our OpenSSL funding not be accessible by
only one person, as that person could be run over by a beer truck.

Unfortunately a U.S. bank is less than ideal for a non-U.S. centric
organization with funding largely originating from, and spent, outside
the U.S.

We have been less successful in finding a non-U.S. bank willing to have
us as a customer, and not for lack of trying. If you know of a
*specific* bank that would help us please name it (offline if need be).
If we haven't already tried them we will.

&gt;<i> Throw in the prospect of earning transaction fees on an

</I>&gt;<i> further.
</I>
The U.S. payment processors I've talked to don't like the fact that our
web servers are all located outside the U.S. Based on an offline tip
from another user I've spent a good part of this morning on the phone
with a global payments provider; we're at the familiar &quot;uh, we'll have
to run this by underwriting&quot; stage.
