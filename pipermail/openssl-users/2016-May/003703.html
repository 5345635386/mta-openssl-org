<PRE>i am sorry if i have wasted your time on non-profit formation and taxation 
issues when i put my CPA hat on. i originally meant to point out some banking 
alternatives and how to make certain you could qualify and control such with the 
non-profit formation as a means and California as a low-cost conduit.

if you are already set up in DE, you can take advantage of the free in-/out-ACH, 
web API's, and mass-pay at dwolla (tied to any existing bank account(s) you have 
now or in the future) and internationally-scoped banking through Citi or some 
such. i suggested Ally Bank only because they offer free services: in-bound 
SWIFT, in-/out-bound domestic US wire transfers, and checking. also, their $10 
fee for out-bound SWIFT is the lowest i know of for non-analysis (low 
running-balance) checking acct's.

Thank you,

Johann v. Preu&#223;en

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Public Interest, Apache, Eclipse Foundation, Open Source Initiative,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Linux Foundation, Software Freedom Conservancy, and many more. i have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> noticed, though, what your attorneys have related to you in that the IRS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has recently seemed to turn a blind eye to the &quot;public benefit&quot; clause
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when it comes to open-source software. this is a trend of just a couple
</I>&gt;<i> Bingo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of years and turns from the path they had followed for decades in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> granting acceptance. if someone took the time to copy/edit one of these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> org's by-laws and submitted to the IRS they would be hard-pressed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deny based on the facts and would have to reveal a decidedly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> philosophical reason which would be wide open to appeal. naturally, i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have no idea if any of this extra effort would yield anything meaningful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to openssl. ...
</I>&gt;<i> Be my guest and go for it, but I do have a good idea if it would yield
</I>&gt;<i> anything meaningful because I've been working this issue in detail for a
</I>&gt;<i> couple of years now. Our attorneys (we've checked with several, and with
</I>&gt;<i> ones experienced with 501(c)) don't see a viable path worth the
</I>&gt;<i> substantial investment it would cost us.
