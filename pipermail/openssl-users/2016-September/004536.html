<PRE>(Can you change your mailer to plaintext, or at least get rid of the black-on-grey styling?)


&gt;<i> Reading the 1.0.2j CHANGES file, it appears that 1.0.2 was built from 1.0.1l.
</I>
That might be the time it was branched off from it.  At that point, the two releases are different.
 
&gt;<i>And my knowledge of OpenSSL is VERY VERY small.
</I>
Okay.  But you are going to have a hard time understanding changes, then.

&gt;<i>Looking at 1.0.1l, out of bug fixes, I've found some changes that do not look as bugfixes:
</I>
Those are security issues.  When someone publishes a paper that shows a weak DH key can be cracked in an hour, then a security toolkit must &quot;move up&quot; to longer keys by default.  This article might be useful: <A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2015/05/20/logjam-freak-upcoming-changes/">https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2015/05/20/logjam-freak-upcoming-changes/</A> and the &quot;SWEET32&quot; article will talk about the DES changes.

&gt;<i> However, only the first one, in bold, appears in 1.0.1l and NOT in 1.0.2j .
</I>
 No.  The entry just before &quot;28 jan&quot; in the CHANGES file.

&gt;<i>Why OpenSSL still delivers 1.0.1* though 1.0.2* should provide the same changes plus new features ?
</I>
Your confusion is thinking that &quot;upgraded security parameters&quot; are new feature, and not security fixes.

&gt;<i>Because change &quot;dhparam: generate 2048-bit parameters by default.&quot; appears in 1.0.1[n-l] and not in 1.0.2* ???
</I>
It is.

&gt;<i> I need to know in order to decide if I still manage 1.0.1 compatibility in addition to delivering 1.0.2[last version] .
</I>
You can do what you want :)  Openssl 1.0.1 becomes unsupported at the end of 2016. If you want to tell your users that you are ending support early, nobody can stop you. :)
