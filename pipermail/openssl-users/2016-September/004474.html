<PRE>Matt, thanks for the reply, very helpful so far! Answers to your questions
below:

You don't say what version of OpenSSL.
&gt;<i>
</I>
The support library I&#8217;m using is Licode:
<A HREF="http://lynckia.com/licode/index.html">http://lynckia.com/licode/index.html</A>

The version of openssl I have compiled into it is 1.0.2h.


&gt;<i> The packet trace you sent is quite confusing, as there appears to be
</I>&gt;<i> two separate handshakes going on at the same time that are interleaved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, apologies for that, I&#8217;ll do a better job of filtering the next time.
:<i>) Those were two separate handshakes pulled from a packet capture of a
</I>group video chat, filtered through Wireshark using the &#8216;dtls&#8217; filter.


&gt;<i> It seems quite clear that this is a retransmit of the earlier message
</I>&gt;<i> from client to server. Retransmits are a normal part of DTLS and are
</I>&gt;<i> there to handle packet loss. If a retransmitted packet is received by
</I>&gt;<i> one of the peers, and it has seen that packet before, then it is simply
</I>&gt;<i> ignored. Wireshark isn't ignoring it, and is reporting it as an &quot;error&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> simply because it has seen it before.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks for that clarification.


&gt;<i> Was this packet capture done on the client side or the server side or
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere in the middle? There appears to be some messages missing.
</I>&gt;<i> In particular I don&#8217;t see any CCS or Finished messages being exchanged.
</I>&gt;<i> Is the network this is over potentially noisy that might explain packet
</I>&gt;<i> loss?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i>From the perspective of the DTLS handshake, my server hosting the Licode
</I>library is the client, and latest stable Chrome browser is the server, if I
understand the terminology correctly. The packet capture was taken from the
client (Licode) side.

Would the CCS or Finished messages have gotten filtered out by the &#8217;dtls&#8217;
filter I applied to the packet capture? I do have the full trace and can
re-filter to just one complete connection over a specific UDP port as you
suggested, let me know if that would be helpful

I see these failures only in situations where browser users with slow
and/or lossy internet are joining, and usually when the group size gets to
be six or more participants. The particular testing scenario that generated
the packets you saw was a user with 225kbps upload, 5120kbps down, 70ms
delay, 0% packet loss.

I&#8217;ll grant you those network conditions aren&#8217;t the best for group video
chat, but if Google Hangouts can pull it off, I&#8217;d like to as well.


&gt;<i> On receiving that the client should respond with a retransmit of
</I>&gt;<i> the Certificate/ClientKeyExchange/CertificateVerify/CCS/Finished
</I>&gt;<i> flight of messages. But it does not appear to do so&#8230;the retransmit does
</I>&gt;<i> not happen until after the encrypted alert.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This sounds like it might be a bug in the Licode library, not resending the
retransmit properly?


&gt;<i> Are both ends of the communication using OpenSSL and if so what versions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i>From my research, I believe Chrome uses borringssl?
