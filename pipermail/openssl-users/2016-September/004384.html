<PRE>Thank you Victor for that valuable analysis. The original self-signed CA file has a NUL at the end which has been propagated when we created the concatenated CA file. We'll have to see how that cert was created and also correct our concatenation routine to cater for trailing NULs.

That will teach me not to make assumptions!

Regards,
John.

The CAcerts.bad file contains a NUL byte at the start of the (should
be) blank line separating two of the certificates.  This prevents OpenSSL from reading the rest of the file.

Cleaned-up CAfiles attached, the server cert verifies with all three.

    $ for file in _CAcerts.*; do echo $file; openssl verify -CAfile $file chain.pem; done
    _CAcerts.bad
    chain.pem: OK
    _CAcerts.bad.fixed
    chain.pem: OK
    _CAcerts.good
    chain.pem: OK
