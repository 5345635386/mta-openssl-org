&gt;<i> From: &quot;Steve Marquess&quot; &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">marquess at openssl.com</A>&gt;

Hello,

&#160; Thanks for your reply.

&gt;<i> You're talking about a Level 2 validation (or higher)? You most
</I>&gt;<i> definitely do *not* want to include the OS or applications in the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cryptographic module boundary&quot; for Level 1.
</I>
It's a level 2.&#160; The behaviour of the unit as a whole is
validated.&#160; As an example amongst many, there will be no Linux
console prompt available in FIPS mode.

&gt;<i> I think you're going to be shocked at the cost (in time and money) to
</I>&gt;<i> validate a hacked OpenSSL FIPS module, compared to using it as-is or a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;change letter&quot; update.
</I>
That brings a question.&#160; I'm currently using 1.0.1k with the 2.0
FIPS module for development purposes.&#160; This may seem a bit blunt,
but, is it possible at all to use 1.0.1k to benefit from the FIPS
validation ?&#160; Based on recent comments I would think not.&#160; Going
back to a pre-heartbleed version ?&#160; Is there any way to benefit
from the gained OpenSSL FIPS validation at all ?

&gt;<i> That's because the CMVP has introduced a number of new
</I>&gt;<i> requirements since the current FIPS module was validated (in
</I>&gt;<i> 2012), and any new validation will now need to satisfy
</I>&gt;<i> those.
</I>
Again, is there any benefit to be gained from using a once
validated OpenSSL FIPS ?&#160; What would be the bugs fixed/ security
updates trade-off ?

&gt;<i> That means not only non-trivial code hacks unrelated to yours,
</I>&gt;<i> but also a new paper shuffle for the &quot;arm waving&quot; (DTR)
</I>&gt;<i> components of the validation process.&#160; The cost of the latter
</I>&gt;<i> dwarfs the former; which is why we have not attempted a new
</I>&gt;<i> validation ourselves.
</I>
Hmmm... If this goes through, would it be possible for OpenSSL to
benefit from any validation our unit can get ?

&gt;<i> But, that cost could be dwarfed in turn by that of a Level 2 or 3
</I>&gt;<i> validation of a turnkey system including OS and apps.
</I>
Thanks again for your comments, much appreciated.

Regards.
