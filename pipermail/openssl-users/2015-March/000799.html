<PRE>In case anyone is following this thread, Matt's suggestion led to the solution.  It turns out we weren't getting a packet from the remote end and all my angst was for naught.  Thanks, Matt, for your help.  N

</I>&gt;<i> I have a client application using a single read-write socket in 
</I>&gt;<i> non-blocking mode. In C, on Linux, using openssl 1.0.1e.  After the 
</I>&gt;<i> connection is established and all the initial handshaking is done, the 
</I>&gt;<i> client issues SSL_read(), then enters a loop of:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -          Interpret results (such as break upon socket close)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -          select() on the socket
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -          SSL_read() again
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> . . . until the expected number of bytes have been read.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first SSL_read() returns SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ and loops to attempt 
</I>&gt;<i> to retry the operation.  But select() indicates that the socket is not 
</I>&gt;<i> readable, so we block forever and the server times out (the server had 
</I>&gt;<i> written a record which the client never reads).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I experimented by skipping the select() and just sleeping a little, 
</I>&gt;<i> but in that case, infinite retries of SSL_read() did not help.  
</I>&gt;<i> Another experiment was to try writing some arbitrary data.  That 
</I>&gt;<i> _/DID/_ seem to help and moved the protocol forwards a bit.  But I 
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't have to do that - we have nothing to write until we have received the full read record.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In case it matters, the server on the other end is an OpenDaylight 
</I>&gt;<i> controller.  Its logs indicate successful handshake, appropriate 
</I>&gt;<i> cipher suite, etc.  And my test client-server application using this 
</I>&gt;<i> logic works just fine.  Also, no SSL_writes() are happening during 
</I>&gt;<i> this, or any other operation that would change the SSL* object state, AFAIK.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've tried Wireshark on this, but I have not been able to glean too 
</I>&gt;<i> much from it, as everything is encrypted and also it seems to be 
</I>&gt;<i> showing transport sized packets of 15xx bytes instead of application 
</I>&gt;<i> sized records - could that be pointing at the problem?  I did not set 
</I>&gt;<i> the read_ahead option.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas?  I have spent hours reading the SSL documentation (such as
</I>&gt;<i> SSL_get_error) and many, many posts and answers, plus several SSL 
</I>&gt;<i> books.  It seems that I am doing the right thing here.  So why is
</I>&gt;<i> select() blocking?  There is no outstanding write operation, so 
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't a retry of SSL_read() clear any handshake/renegotiation stuff?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Are you sure the record that the server wrote actually got sent across the network?

Have you tried connecting to the server using s_client? Does that succeed?

Matt
