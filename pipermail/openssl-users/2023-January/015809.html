<PRE>Hi 

Thanks for your informative response but as per my analysis decryption of video is failing at EVP_DecryptFinal api. Is there any api which can be used. Also, hmac apis are depreciated, do I need to replace any apis for hmac. Please provide the solution for this.

Thanks &amp; Regards
Shweta

 ...

And especially because the actual &quot;fetch&quot; is a one-liner

  EVP_CIPHER_fetch(NULL,
    cipher-&gt;nid == NID_undef ? &quot;NULL&quot; : OBJ_nid2sn(cipher-&gt;nid), &quot;&quot;);

(unless i am mistaken in the loong way to the concrete thing) and several functions like PKCS7_encrypt() do not work with a CIPHER_CTX, and an easy workaround as is possible for digests

  #ifdef a_XTLS_CRYPTO_FETCH
  a_XTLS__JFETCH:/* C99 */{
        EVP_MD_CTX *mdcp;

        if((mdcp = EVP_MD_CTX_new()) == NIL)
           *mdp = NIL;
        else{
           if(!EVP_DigestInit_ex(mdcp, *mdp, NIL))
              *mdp = NIL;
           EVP_MD_CTX_free(mdcp);
        }
        goto jleave;
     }
  #endif

is not possible because EncryptInit_ex takes additional parameters that may not be known (easily).
Maybe irony can be found in words as of postfix

  Workaround: OpenSSL 3.x EVP_get_digestbyname() can return
  lazily bound handles that may fail to work when one attempts
  to use them, because no provider search happens until one
  constructs an actual operation context. In sufficiently
  hostile configurations, Postfix could mistakenly believe
  that an algorithm is available, when in fact it is not. A
  similar workaround may be needed for EVP_get_cipherbyname().
  Fix by Viktor Dukhovni. Files: tls/tls.h, tls/tls_dane.c,
  tls/tls_fprint.c, tls/tls_misc.c.

And, finally, how could anyone write a configurator, as is my

      link_check tls_blake2 'TLS: BLAKE2 digests' \
        '#define mx_XTLS_HAVE_BLAKE2' &lt;&lt; \!
  #include &lt;openssl/evp.h&gt;
  int main(void){
    EVP_blake2b512();
    EVP_blake2s256();
    return 0;
  }
  !

when the above is, in fact, totally meaningless, and _running_ this thing (as via run_check()) is not possible in cross-compilation scenarios?

Wouldn't it make sense to at least say those direct accessors are guaranteed to return a valid usable object if the above configuration check succeeds and the standard standard OSSL_LIB_CTX is in use (aka has not been set explicitly, or been used explicitily in a _fetch())?
Fine thing with the magic carpet change, but all programs i deal with (aka use) simply need that &quot;old&quot; behaviour, reliably.
Only my one cent.

So i for myself keep the cipher code &quot;as-is&quot;, but then do

  ...looking up configure-time detected arrays of useful things..
  ..and (new!) set &quot;cp&quot; to the name of the found thing, and jump..

  #if defined mx_HAVE_TLS_ALL_ALGORITHMS &amp;&amp; !defined a_XTLS_CRYPTO_FETCH
     if((cipher = EVP_get_cipherbyname(cp)) != NIL)
        goto jleave;
  #endif

  #ifdef a_XTLS_CRYPTO_FETCH
  a_XTLS__JFETCH:
     if((cipher = EVP_CIPHER_fetch(NIL, cp, NIL)) != NIL){
        *freeit = TRU1;
        goto jleave;
     }
  #endif

..and do a &quot;re-&quot;fetch.  Well it seems to work, and the call tree is pretty shallow for the new &quot;freeit&quot; parameter.

This is all dynamic now, a.k.a. the Olymp of programming, but waiting with cheering.
But congratulations for the QUIC implementation again!
