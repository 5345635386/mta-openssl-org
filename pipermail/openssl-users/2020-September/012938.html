Perhaps so, but the mechanism needs to be general enough to avoid
making that assumption.

The encryption of private keys is at the PEM object level, not at the
file level, so encrypted keys co&#235;xist just fine with cleartext cert
chains in the same file.

&gt;<i> It probably also fails if the private key is in an HSM (and you don't

</I>
This is a better argument for also offering a multifile model, because
indeed in that case the key is not even in a file, all one has is some
sort of key handle.  I'm much less familiar with how one handles key
and cert rotation with HSMs.  This used to mean engines, but all that
is changing in OpenSSL 3.0.0, so TBD.  If both the key and the cert
chain became just handles to data fetched each time they're needed,
then the entire problem might become moot.  But it may prove tricky
to present a uniform interface to both PEM files and HSMs that works
robustly for both under their respective operational models.

&gt;<i> In all algorithms I'm aware of, the public key can be derived from the private key,

</I>&gt;<i> certificate.  (I seem to remember some attack on some systems where doing that

</I>
Yes, OpenSSL generally supports checking that the public key in
the leaf certificate matches the public key portion of the private
key, but in fact with HSMs where the public and private keys may
be just opaque handles, such a check is not always possible, in
that case one might actually need to attempt to sign something,
and see whether the signature is valid...  I don't recall the
details.  See 

    <A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/ssl/ssl_rsa.c#L148-L192">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/ssl/ssl_rsa.c#L148-L192</A>

and related functions and also:

&gt;<i> So it seems that we can easily use the mis-match of the keys to trigger a
</I>&gt;<i> check on the private key file, and if we can't load it (passphrase, etc),
</I>&gt;<i> then we could actually reject reloading the certificate file.
</I>
Right, and then backoff, retry, etc.  Folks who elect a single-file
format, and execute rollovers correctly can avoid the associated costs.

&gt;<i> Oh, and while I think that openssl should have some reference code that uses
</I>&gt;<i> openat(), I rather suggest that this is reference code.  Let the application
</I>&gt;<i> deal with setting up and processing the file update events, and calling
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL to potentially load a new certificate/key pair.
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL should focus on the reference counting needed underneath.
</I>
Yes, that's fine, but in that case more explicit code is needed at the
application layer to &quot;make it go&quot;.  Lots of tradeoffs.

In any case this is a good project for someone suitably skilled.
Ideally, design and documentation before code!
