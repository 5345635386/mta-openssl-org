<PRE>A SSL_CTX api seem like a good idea to provide additional guarantees to
applications.

Maybe Openssl - used as a library - can return to the other legacy
applications that the certificate is &quot;deemed not valid any more&quot; whenever
they try to use an outdated pointer?

This ought to be a transparent scenario for a legacy application which *at
the same time* also do frequent cert rolling.

Would it be appropriate to record some excerpts of this discussion in
github gist? I can be the secretary, if that would be uncontroversial.

</I>&gt;<i> So far, not much, just some rough notes on the obvious obstacles.

</I>&gt;<i> be sufficiently Unix-like) and gracefully handling processes that drop
</I>&gt;<i> privs will be challenging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not all applications will want the same approach, so there'd need to be

</I>&gt;<i> the sanest approach (but one that does nothing for legacy applications)
</I>&gt;<i> is to provide an API that returns the *latest* SSL_CTX via some new
</I>&gt;<i> handle that under the covers constructs a new SSL_CTX as needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     SSL_CTX *SSL_Factory_get1_CTX(SSL_CTX_FACTORY *);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would yield a reference-counted SSL_CTX that each caller must
</I>&gt;<i> ultimately release via SSL_CTX_free() to avoid a leak.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ... factory construction API calls ...

</I>&gt;<i>     ...
</I>&gt;<i>     SSL_free(ssl);                          -- ctx ref count &gt;= 1
</I>&gt;<i>     SSL_CTX_free(ctx);                      -- ctx may be freed here
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To address the needs of legacy clients is harder, because they
</I>&gt;<i> expect an SSL_CTX &quot;in hand&quot; to be valid indefinitely, but now
</I>&gt;<i> we want to be able age out and free old contexts, so we want
</I>&gt;<i> some mechanism by which it becomes safe to free old contexts
</I>&gt;<i> that we're sure no thread is still using.  This is difficult
</I>&gt;<i> to do right, because some thread may be blocked for a long
</I>&gt;<i> time, before becoming active again and using an already known
</I>&gt;<i> SSL_CTX pointer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is not exactly clear how multi-threaded unmodified legacy software
</I>&gt;<i> can be ensured crash free without memory leaks while behind the scenes
</I>&gt;<i> we're constantly mutating the SSL_CTX.  Once a pointer to an SSL_CTX
</I>&gt;<i> has been read, it might be squirreled away in all kinds of places, and
</I>&gt;<i> here's just no way to know that it won't be used indefinitely.
