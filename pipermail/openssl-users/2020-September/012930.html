</I>&gt;<i> openat(2) to read each file relative to the directory in question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most application code is not written that way, but conceivably OpenSSL
</I>&gt;<i> could have an interface for loading a key and certchain from two (or
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps even more for the cert chain) files relative to a given

</I>&gt;<i> whether something similar is possible on Windows.
</I>On NT-based window, the undocumented Zw family of file I/O syscalls
would do what you call &quot;openat()&quot;, &quot;current dir&quot; is in fact a directory
handle plus string equivalent stored in a user mode variable in one
of the core shared objects, which is why rmdir fails if it is the current
directory of any process.

&gt;<i> The above is *complicated*.  Requiring a single file for both key and
</I>&gt;<i> cert is far simpler.  Either PEM with key + cert or perhaps (under
</I>&gt;<i> duress) even PKCS#12.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Does it look like we are actually getting somewhere here?
</I>&gt;<i> So far, not much, just some rough notes on the obvious obstacles.
</I>&gt;<i> There's a lot more to do to design a usable framework for always fresh
</I>&gt;<i> keys.  Keeping it portable between Windows and Unix (assuming MacOS will
</I>&gt;<i> be sufficiently Unix-like) and gracefully handling processes that drop
</I>&gt;<i> privs will be challenging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not all applications will want the same approach, so there'd need to be
</I>&gt;<i> various knobs to set to choose one of the supported modes.  Perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> the sanest approach (but one that does nothing for legacy applications)
</I>&gt;<i> is to provide an API that returns the *latest* SSL_CTX via some new
</I>&gt;<i> handle that under the covers constructs a new SSL_CTX as needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      SSL_CTX *SSL_Factory_get1_CTX(SSL_CTX_FACTORY *);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would yield a reference-counted SSL_CTX that each caller must
</I>&gt;<i> ultimately release via SSL_CTX_free() to avoid a leak.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      ... factory construction API calls ...
</I>&gt;<i>      ctx = SSL_Factory_get1_CTX(factory);    -- ctx ref count &gt;= 1
</I>&gt;<i>      SSL *ssl = SSL_CTX_new(ctx);            -- ctx ref count &gt;= 2
</I>&gt;<i>      ...
</I>&gt;<i>      SSL_free(ssl);                          -- ctx ref count &gt;= 1
</I>&gt;<i>      SSL_CTX_free(ctx);                      -- ctx may be freed here
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To address the needs of legacy clients is harder, because they
</I>&gt;<i> expect an SSL_CTX &quot;in hand&quot; to be valid indefinitely, but now
</I>&gt;<i> we want to be able age out and free old contexts, so we want
</I>&gt;<i> some mechanism by which it becomes safe to free old contexts
</I>&gt;<i> that we're sure no thread is still using.  This is difficult
</I>&gt;<i> to do right, because some thread may be blocked for a long
</I>&gt;<i> time, before becoming active again and using an already known
</I>&gt;<i> SSL_CTX pointer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is not exactly clear how multi-threaded unmodified legacy software
</I>&gt;<i> can be ensured crash free without memory leaks while behind the scenes
</I>&gt;<i> we're constantly mutating the SSL_CTX.  Once a pointer to an SSL_CTX
</I>&gt;<i> has been read, it might be squirreled away in all kinds of places, and
</I>&gt;<i> here's just no way to know that it won't be used indefinitely.
</I>&gt;<i>
