Slowing down an attack on an already compromised system is simply not a
design goal for OpenSSL 3.0. Nor was it for the FIPS Object Module 2.0
AFAIK although it might have been an accidental by-product. Once your
system is compromised there are so many ways to attack it that I
severely doubt whether the difference between static vs dynamic linking
is going to make much difference to the overall result.

But ultimately you know your application context better than I do. From
an OpenSSL perspective the decision to use dynamic linking for the FIPS
provider was fundamental and meant that we could avoid a whole heap of
problems that plagued the FOM 2.0. This isn't a design decision that is
likely to be reversed - and certainly could not be in the 3.0 timescale.
You will have to weigh the security pros and cons of this for your context.
