</I>i believe this was all from back in the 0.9x days, the code in question 
is close to 10+/- years old

if everyone would look at the email thread&#160; re: &quot;ssl client write / 
server accept seems broken&quot;

some might see more of the issue i am facing, i have has 1 person look 
at this and he believes

This looks like using *very* outdated OpenSSL API. Hence the SSL
client (and server) code needs to ported to work with more recent
versions OpenSSL and make use of TLS methods instead of SSL methods.

For testing you could try to build OpenSSL with the old SSL3 support
enabled (we don't even support that at all in OpenWrt any longer, but
should work to build manually).
Because ssl_undefined_function is most likely a result of:
Disabled features:
...
 &#160; &#160; ssl3&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [default] OPENSSL_NO_SSL3
 &#160; &#160; ssl3-method&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;[default] OPENSSL_NO_SSL3_METHOD
...

If you find someone very familiar with OpenSSLs API (I've used it, more
than once, but it's not what I'm doing every day), this can be done in
a few days. I'd probably need a week for this and I'm not particularly
keen on it, there are things I'm better with which are waiting as well.&quot;

i now have a second developer looking at this, so hoping he can sort it 
all out.
