</I>&gt;<i> The good news is that if there were an OpenSSL bug somewhat associated

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'd suggest to run something like wireshark and capture the TLS 
handshake - if I do that against jnior.com I see that the jnior.com 
certificate has a X509 cert extension unknown to my rather old Wireshark 
version, but that should not matter much. Wireshark will give you 
detailed info about the EC Diffie-Hellman Server Params that were sent 
over the wire, including the signature. Wireshark does not indicate any 
problems there, although I am not sure if it *would* , if there was a 
problem.

However, it will give you an easy method to see what wireshark thinks 
the signature is compared to what your code thinks the signature is.

As a side-remark: I did notice your server cert is using 3072 bit RSA 
whereas the CAs are based on 2048bit RSA - nothing wrong with that, but 
do make sure your code can handle that (under normal circumstances it 
would not be an issue).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [1] I'm not sure &quot;validate&quot; is the proper term here, technically speaking. In my experience, the literature usually uses &quot;verify&quot; for confirming a signature. &quot;Validate&quot; is generally used for more complex protocols, such as certificate validation, which involves a large number of steps with various types of checks.
