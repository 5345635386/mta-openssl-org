<PRE>At the moment there are 3 open PRs related to Kernel TLS offload
support that I'm aware of:

- 11589 adds TLS1.3 for Linux, has one approval from Matt Caswell
- 10626 adds TLS1.3 for FreeBSD, from which 11589 is derived, but will
  need to be rebased on top of 11589 once it is merged
- 11679 adds TLS1.[012] RX offload for FreeBSD, but would conflict
  a bit with 11589

Matt has already approved 11589, and I think 11589 looks ok from
my vantage point (I'm more familiar with the KTLS infrastructure
in FreeBSD rather than Linux).  Given that 11589 has received the
most review, I think it is probably prudent for it to be merged
first at for me to then rebase the other two PRs on top of that
and resolve conflicts, etc.

Is there anything I can do to help with getting 11589 merged?  I'm
not an OpenSSL committer, so I can't formally add the second
approval it needs.  Similarly once 11589 lands, is there anything
I can do to help get review on the other two PRs once they are
updated?

Ideally I'd really like to have these three merged into 3.0 before
it is released.  I'm already maintaining a side branch of 1.1.1
with KTLS support for use in FreeBSD's ports tree, but it would be
really nice if 3.0 did not require additional patches out of the
box.

Thanks!
