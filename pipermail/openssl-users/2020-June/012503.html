Hi Phillip,

@all: If this goes too far off-topic for the openssl mailing list, let me 
know, and I'll continue the discussion off-mailing-list.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sry, I missed that before. I have just read the draft, now.

&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nope, I haven't got a fully finished scheme for the Shamir Secret Sharing
</I>&gt;<i> t&lt;n version (yet) that begins with a distributed key generation scheme.&#160;
</I>
ok, I see.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, I have yet to fully grock how that starts. Do we have n people
</I>&gt;<i> participate or t? I can carry the math part. But there seems to be this gap
</I>&gt;<i> when I try to move to ceremony...
</I>
Well, there is only t parts of information in there (e.g. if t parties 
would share their secrets, the other n-t secrets could be reconstructed). 
So one way would be to have t parties &quot;settle on a shared key&quot; and 
calculate the n-t other secrets - but this creates some asymmetry between 
the trust in the parties. Maybe it's instead possible to have n parties 
create secrets, and then &quot;project&quot; this n-dimensional key onto some 
t-dimensional hyperplane without actually sending the secrets around? 
(This might work with the &quot;n points of a polinomial of degree t-1&quot; 
approach, too: &quot;projecting&quot; would refer to some kind of fitting, there)

So everyone would do:
1. create some secret
2. send some information around
3. calculate the component of &quot;his coordinate&quot; of the perpendicular to the 
t-dimensional hyperplane
4. subtract that from his secret

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What are you hoping to use this CA for? It it is to issue WebPKI (i.e. get
</I>&gt;<i> your root embedded in a browser) certs then CABForum writes the rules. They
</I>&gt;<i> have picked a set of algorithms/ curves they like.&#160;
</I>
Yes, it should become the root CA for OpenNIC to certify webservers. At 
some point (very long shot), it might get included in browers, but I 
honestly do not expect this to happen within the next decade ;-) 
Nevertheless, we would like to avoid any trivially-avoidable obstacles and 
create a CA that is as much conformant to the rules as possible :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But you have to use HSMs and that is a bigger constraint and none of that
</I>&gt;<i> supports threshold - or is likely to for some time.
</I>
Hmm, I was afraid, we would need HSMs, too. Your draft mentions, that one 
of the participants could be an HSM - but I guess, this a) is not (yet) 
implemented and b) does not scale to more than 1 HSM because of the 
statelessness of the HSM (one would need at least n-t+1 HSMs, to satisfy 
the &quot;have to use HSMs&quot; condition, I guess). Am I right? If so, we will 
refrain from our bold goal of being included in browser bundles and simply 
not use HSMs.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Ok, so we will probably say good bye to the
</I>&gt;<i>       separately-created-key
</I>&gt;<i>       approach and split a given secret key which we will afterwards
</I>&gt;<i>       securely
</I>&gt;<i>       erase (and only keep the parts).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is the simplest one as far as ceremony goes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       &gt; For the set of applications I care about, this attack is not
</I>&gt;<i>       actually that
</I>&gt;<i>       &gt; important because while Mallet knows the secret key, he is the
</I>&gt;<i>       only person
</I>&gt;<i>       &gt; who does. And so he won't be able to respond to any composite
</I>&gt;<i>       signature
</I>&gt;<i>       &gt; request with a valid answer.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       But he can still sign anything he wants, right? Or does he never
</I>&gt;<i>       see the
</I>&gt;<i>       csr, but only the &quot;preprocessed&quot; csr, so he cannot sign it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well he can sign anything he wants but why is that key accredited to
</I>&gt;<i> anything else? Why is it considered to be a trustworthy key for that group
</I>&gt;<i> of signers?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is what I am trying to get at with mention of 'CSR' - there has to be
</I>&gt;<i> some 'get trusted' process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i>       &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>       &gt; So for PKIX type applications, this is self defeating as only
</I>&gt;<i>       Mallet can
</I>&gt;<i>       &gt; generate the CSR.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Why would they want to create CSRs? In our case, this is
</I>&gt;<i>       intended to be
</I>&gt;<i>       the Root CA.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Its been over a decade since I last stood up a production CA. It is really a
</I>&gt;<i> matter of ceremony design. Having the offline root first generate a CSR and
</I>&gt;<i> then accept the CSR by signing it means that the ceremony for generating the
</I>&gt;<i> self signed root is the same as that for the subordinates for a start.&#160;
</I>
Ah, I see: When creating the self-signature of the CA itself, the 
threshold signature will fail, because the keys do not fit. Although 
Mallet can create a valid self-signature, no one would use it, because 
it's clear, that this was not created by the threshold signature 
algorithm.


Can you please share some running code, that implements the t&lt;n threshold 
signing and the key splitting (from a single key)?


regards,
Erich
