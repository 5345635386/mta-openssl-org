<PRE>Thank you JJK and everyone!!

Jan, that was it! Never thought to check the key size. Just too close to
it I guess. I could handle the 2,048 bit keys but set a fixed maximum
register size of 4,096 bits. Well, it needs 6,144 bits to do the 3,072
bit math. My bad as they say. I do have a ToDo in the comments to
implement dynamic sizing. After all, my target is just a
micro-controller based device at 100 MHz. Security needs to be
functional and, well, not necessarily strong. Most neglect to move away
from default passwords. Ugh.

I'll probably roll jnior.com back to 2,048. I did not purposely set the
larger key size. Must have been someone's idea of a good default.

Oh... and it was Ethereal before Wireshark. I had to look it up.
Starting to get concerned about my memory. But, I do have valid 30-year
old backups of past systems and am certain I can I actually pull a
version off that if I really wanted.

I was just adding Elliptic Curve capabilities to my TLS as something to
do during this pandemic. Yeah, finally. It is an academic endeavor in
keeping with my DIY edict.

Thank you all. And, Jan you are a star!!

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That is happening with this one server installation using Apache in a

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I use the public key extracted from the supplied certificate to decrypt

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (and signatures verify/validate/match) in every other connection attempt
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to other servers (including google.com). It also works with this Apache
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> server before we move away from the default key and certificate files.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Basically, our server is using some other key for this. Maybe still the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> default. After we point configuration to a new certificate and key.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah, I had at first thought that there was an intrusion. But in testing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with a clean sandboxed server we see the same results. Yes, it is most
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> likely an Apache configuration issue but, we've dug through all of that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and nothing jumps out.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So either we haven't configured every possible corner of this Apache
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> server correctly, or there is some odd extension to TLS that I've
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> missed. But as you all know, debugging in this area is difficult.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> jnior.com is obviously public and we need to know if we have it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> improperly configured. But, I need to know why in this one instance my
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> TLS implementation fails. In either case, it is an symptom that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> shouldn't be ignored as you would agree.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The good news is that if there were an OpenSSL bug somewhat associated
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with this, you all would have already mentioned it (I assume).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd suggest to run something like wireshark and capture the TLS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handshake - if I do that against jnior.com I see that the jnior.com
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certificate has a X509 cert extension unknown to my rather old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Wireshark version, but that should not matter much. Wireshark will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> give you detailed info about the EC Diffie-Hellman Server Params that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were sent over the wire, including the signature. Wireshark does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indicate any problems there, although I am not sure if it *would* , if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there was a problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, it will give you an easy method to see what wireshark thinks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the signature is compared to what your code thinks the signature is.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As a side-remark: I did notice your server cert is using 3072 bit RSA
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whereas the CAs are based on 2048bit RSA - nothing wrong with that,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but do make sure your code can handle that (under normal circumstances
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it would not be an issue).
