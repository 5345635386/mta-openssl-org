<PRE>You may also check out the results of the popular ssllabs.com test here:

<A HREF="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=jnior.com&amp;hideResults=on">https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=jnior.com&amp;hideResults=on</A>

Note however that in recent years they have become quite aggressive in
labeling things as &quot;weak&quot; when they are simply &quot;slightly less than the
best that the latestbig-brand browsers support&quot; with no consideration
for servers that try to provide compatibility for older clients in
addition to the latest hype.

As for the signature on the key exchange in SSL3/TLS1.0/TLS1.1/TLS 1.2
and the final signature in TLS1.3, those are the one signature that
causes the certificates to do anything meaningful, so I would expect all
but the most crappy clients to check it and make a very serious error
message &quot;SOMEONE IS HACKING YOUR CONNECTION, PULL THE PLUG NOW!&quot; or
something equally serious.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  From your description, it sounds like an Apache issue, not an OpenSSL one. I don't know enough about Apache configuration to comment. (I've configured a few Apache instances in my day, but never had any real issues with it, so I've never done more than search the docs for what I needed and implemented it.)
