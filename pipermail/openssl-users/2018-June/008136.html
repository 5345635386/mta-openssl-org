<PRE>&gt;<i> Of course people have been harvesting entropy, or trying to, from network
</I>&gt;<i> sources for decades. There's a famous paragraph regarding it in RFC 4086,
</I>&gt;<i> which is an expanded version of a similar statement from RFC 1750 (1994):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Other external events, such as network packet arrival times and
</I>&gt;<i>     lengths, can also be used, but only with great care.  In particular,
</I>&gt;<i>     the possibility of manipulation of such network traffic measurements
</I>&gt;<i>     by an adversary and the lack of history at system start-up must be
</I>&gt;<i>     carefully considered.  If this input is subject to manipulation, it
</I>&gt;<i>     must not be trusted as a source of entropy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (RFC 4086, 3.5)
</I>
Good point about the possibility of manipulation; it sounds a bit
far-fetched but so did a lot of other exploits before they became a
reality.

&gt;<i> More generally: It's often possible to harvest quite a bit of information
</I>&gt;<i> that can't be adequately predicted or statistically modeled by an attacker
</I>&gt;<i> from network sources, and these days distilling CPRNG entropy from such
</I>&gt;<i> inputs is straightforward thanks to the use of cryptographic compression
</I>&gt;<i> functions. It's the edge cases that bite you. 4086 mentions attacker
</I>&gt;<i> manipulation (flooding network sources with known data to flush entropy
</I>&gt;<i> out of the pool) and start-up (if you don't have persistent storage of
</I>&gt;<i> adequate seed material). Embedded devices may suffer from too little, or
</I>&gt;<i> too predictable, network traffic in their limited reception area.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can get stronger guarantees from hardware entropy devices, which are
</I>&gt;<i> cheap (in every sense: component cost, power consumption, size, ...). So
</I>&gt;<i> there's not a lot of incentive to do more research into gathering entropy
</I>&gt;<i> from external sources - it makes more sense to lean on device
</I>&gt;<i> manufacturers, or use add-on devices.
</I>
Or carry forward entropy across reboots, provided that can be done without
exposing another attack surface; or obtaining entropy from a trusted
source if you can figure out how to make a secure connection with that
source. My experience with &quot;lean[ing] on device manufacturers&quot; is not all
that positive.
