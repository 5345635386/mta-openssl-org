</I>&gt;<i>    SSL_read() to get that data. If that call cannot be completed due
</I>&gt;<i>    to SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ/SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE, poll the fd until
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i>    condition is met. Then repeat calling SSL_read(). So I'm
</I>&gt;<i> repeatedly
</I>&gt;<i>    calling SSL_read() until it reports SSL_ERROR_NONE.  With this I
</I>&gt;<i>    satisfy the requirement of the OpenSSL-API to repeat an incomplete
</I>&gt;<i>    call until it completes.  Although I did not read that exactly in
</I>&gt;<i>    the man-pages, the non-blocking-example in &quot;Network Security with
</I>&gt;<i>    OpenSSL&quot; by Viega et al. takes care not to interleave the calls to
</I>&gt;<i>    SSL_write()/SSL_read().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. (The program reaches here only after SSL_read() has succeeded or
</I>&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;<i>    it has not even tried to call SSL_read() as the socket was not
</I>&gt;<i>    readable) If the peer has data that needs to be sent to the other
</I>&gt;<i>    side, call SSL_write() for it. If that function returns with
</I>&gt;<i>    SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE poll the fd
</I>&gt;<i> accordingly
</I>&gt;<i>    and repeat SSL_write() until it ends with SSL_ERROR_NONE. Then go
</I>&gt;<i>    to #1 to check for incoming data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The code above does what I want - except for renegotiations! 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the peer receives a renegotiation-request its socket becomes
</I>&gt;<i> readable just like if it received a normal SSL-record with user-data.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus my program enters #1 and repeats SSL_read() until SSL_ERROR_NONE
</I>&gt;<i> is returned. But this never happens in that case, because the other
</I>&gt;<i> peer just sent the renegotiation-packet(s) but no other data. So I'm
</I>&gt;<i> stuck in repeating SSL_read() and won't enter #2 until the peer that
</I>&gt;<i> forced the renegotiation has sent any other data to make SSL_read()
</I>&gt;<i> finish (which may take very long in my program).
</I>
You've basically answered your question yourself - you cannot do it
like this - switching phases #1 and #2, but instead you need to go to
the writing phase (i.e. start writing if you have anything to pass to
SSL_write) whenever you need to wait on data to be read to appear in
the socket.

No matter how far down the wrong road you've gone, turn back.
