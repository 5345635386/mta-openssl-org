&gt;<i> Date: Wed, 6 Jun 2018 16:12:59 +0000
</I>&gt;<i> From: Michael Wojcik &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">Michael.Wojcik at microfocus.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hence my solution of using a hardware TRNG shared over the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> network with devices that lack the ability to have one added
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> locally.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I think that's a good approach. It reduces the attack surface,
</I>&gt;<i> since the client device can connect to the entropy-gathering device
</I>&gt;<i> with considerable assurance (it can be configured with a pinned CA
</I>&gt;<i> or PSK, etc), and at startup can use some entropy saved from the
</I>&gt;<i> previous run. An attacker in a privileged position could try active
</I>&gt;<i> attacks like a DoS against the connection to the entropy server, but
</I>&gt;<i> a (more dangerous) passive attack looks very difficult.
</I>
Speaking of attack scenarios, I refreshed my info after this discussion
and wondered how likely it is that someone (in a Linux world) would want
to attack the entropy *sources* directly. A manipulated source's effect
on applications (that read from /dev/random) would be somewhat limited
due to the kernel folding in other sources as well (memento Linus'
statement about RDRAND), and due to the fact that *many* consumers read
from it (you cannot predict who gets which part of your manipulated
entropy).

For comparison, imagine someone attacking the kernel and manipulating
the /dev/random driver so that it feeds predictable sequences to the
targets (processes running executables &quot;httpd&quot;, &quot;gpg&quot;, etc.) but real
pool data to all other consumers. Presto, a subverted system that still
gets a clean bill of health from rngtest, ent, dieharder, or whatever
other analyzer you care to try ...

... by which I mean to ask, since I read a quest for suitable
entropy-distribution protocols between the lines here, maybe there is
something to be said in favor of signed-at-source chunks of entropy
being forwarded *through* the kernel unchanged, and leaving the
trust-based selection of sources and final folding to the individual
applications?

&gt;<i> And it's practical for real-world data centers; implementation and
</I>&gt;<i> equipment costs are low.
</I>
[has been trying to acquire a better *NTP* source than public unsigned
servers in certain data centers for 8+ years] :-C
