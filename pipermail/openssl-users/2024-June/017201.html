him.

 |&gt;|&gt;   Jun  7 23:41:16 outwall/smtpd[19222]: warning: run-time library \
 |&gt;|&gt;   vs. compile-time header version mismatch: OpenSSL 3.3.0 may not \
 |&gt;|&gt;   be compatible with OpenSSL 3.2.0
 |&gt;  ...
 |&gt;|[.] OpenSSL 3.2.0 and 3.3.0
 |&gt;|are ABI and API compatible. I would not expect to see a warning or
 |&gt;|error. See &lt;<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/policies/general/versioning-policy.h\">https://www.openssl.org/policies/general/versioning-policy.h\</A>
 |&gt;|tml&gt;.
 |
 |Some irrelevant background: that document covers OpenSSL 3.0 and
 |later (earlier releases use a different versioning scheme).
 |
 |&gt;|From the document under Minor Release:
 |&gt;|
 |&gt;|    A minor release is indicated by changing the second number of the
 |&gt;|    version. A minor release can, and generally will, introduce new
 |&gt;|    features. However both the API and ABI will be preserved.
 |
 |That same document says under &quot;Patch release&quot;:
 |
 |    A patch release is indicated by changing the final number of
 |    the version. A patch release will only contain bug and security
 |    fixes. Both the API and ABI will remain compatible across patch
 |    releases.
 |
 |Note that only the text for &quot;Patch release&quot; promises that the &quot;Both
 |the API and ABI will remain compatible&quot;.

Hm, you have read the page, and i think Jeffrey is right in noting
that, effectively, the [.] log message is technically false.

However i also think the OpenSSL page is very confusing, as you
correctly point out, since

  For example, a program built with OpenSSL release 3.0.1 will be
  able to run with OpenSSL 3.1.0 but might not be able to take
  advantage of new features without modification.

how could a program compiled for 3.0.1 use features at all which
were introduced with a later minor version.
Btw they also say it *could* happen also here, with the same
&quot;Exceptions to these rules require a vote by the OMC.&quot; clause they
use for API/ABI breakage for minor releases.

  ...
 |&gt; [.] I must say, out of my head i have no idea
 |&gt; whether it has always been like that for minor releases for one,
 |&gt; and whether that is also true for LibreSSL, and the other SSL
 |&gt; libraries that [.] possibly works with.  And [.] did
 |&gt; use LibreSSL for some time in the past.
