Committing a fashion faux pas may be gauche, but pointing and laughing
is even more so.&#160; If you think that somebody's choice of fashion is
inappropriate, keep it to yourself or an appropriate gossip forum.&#160;
Congratulations, you've just convinced this newcomer that the
openssl-users group is populated by fashionistas rather than serious
technical people.

The original poster had a technical question.&#160; I don't know enough to
answer it, or I would.&#160; Could somebody who *does* know enough please
take a stab?

Saiteja, one suggestion:&#160; when an error occurs, don't just report that
there was a problem.&#160; Report what the problem was.&#160; Don't these
functions set the results that SSL_get_error( ) returns?
