</I>I think you need to be a lot more clear for anyone to understand your
problem.

What exactly do you mean by &quot;control data&quot;?

What is the layering of protocols here?
Is it:
 &#160;&#160; bulk data =&gt; WebSockets =&gt; TLS =&gt; TCP =&gt; network
Or
 &#160;&#160; bulk data =&gt; TLS =&gt; WebSockets =&gt; TLS =&gt; TCP =&gt; network

In what direction is the bulk data being sent: TLS client to TLS
server or TLS server to TLS client?

In what direction is the initial 31 byte &quot;control packet&quot; being
sent: TLS client to TLS server or TLS server to TLS client?

Also, if possible, could you report the (decrypted if applicable)
content of those initial 31 bytes?&#160; Perhaps also the later 31 byte
packets (including their order of occurrence and direction of
transmission)?

Can you see what the &quot;packets&quot; are?

For example, are they TLS alert messages?

Are they TLS HelloRequest messages?


Enjoy
