Sorry, I wasn't trying to propose any particular concrete interfaces.&#160; I
was trying to speak abstractly:&#160; &quot;a client should be able to say 'give
me a secure connection to host:port' and have sensible and secure things
happen with a single call.&#160; Maybe two, one to create a handle and the
other to actually set up the connection (to allow for intervening calls
that customize the connection).&quot;&#160; (OK, yeah, I did get a bit more
concrete later, but I never said &quot;change the existing functions&quot;.)

&gt;<i> Of course, anyone's free to write their own API on top of what OpenSSL provides, and even make a pull request to contribute it to the project.
</I>
If only I had the time.&#160; I do greatly respect the work that people do on
FOSS projects.&#160; I just wish more would focus on getting the common cases
to be easy and bulletproof, and less on being all things to all people.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Looking at it another way:&#160; browsers manage to do it...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Manage to do what, exactly? And how are browsers a good model for the vast range of OpenSSL applications? They're
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  just one type of client that nearly always uses a very particular PKI model.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Manage to make reasonably secure connections with a minimum of user hassle.
</I>&gt;<i> Still just one type of client.
</I>
Maybe I just don't have a big enough picture, but in my TLS-related work
(mostly client LDAP, but some other stuff) I keep coming back to a
browser as the behavior that I should emulate.

&gt;<i> Frankly, what I'd like is fewer people using OpenSSL at all. Not
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily fewer applications, but fewer *people*. Cryptography and
</I>&gt;<i> security are inherently difficult; TLS is particularly bad, because of
</I>&gt;<i> its history, configurability, interoperability demands, and
</I>&gt;<i> horrendously broken PKI. It's an area for experts. I'd like the
</I>&gt;<i> barrier to entry to be *higher*, so we'd see fewer people posting
</I>&gt;<i> messages like &quot;I tried to write a server using OpenSSL but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> understand cipher suites&quot;. 
</I>
What should they use instead?

What *should* core OpenSSL developers be focused on?

And why should callers have to understand cipher suites at any deep
level?&#160; Why should they need to know any more than &quot;there are multiple
algorithms, and new algorithms are introduced occasionally, and old
algorithms are defeated occasionally, but you may need old algorithms
for interoperability, so you need to have a way to select which
algorithms you accept&quot;?&#160; That's pretty much the limits of my mental
model; what am I missing?
