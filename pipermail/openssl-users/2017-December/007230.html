Indeed. This has little to do with &quot;the values of western society&quot;, or the values of any other community. (Nor, with apologies to Richard, does it have much to do with the OpenSSL mailing-list code of conduct; the messages on this topic have ranged from curt to civil, but none have been abusive under any reasonable definition.)

It has to do with appealing to the intended audience, which of course is one of the most critical aspects of writing. I could cite thousands of years of rhetorical theory - from cultures European and otherwise - but this is such a commonplace that there's no need. Marty's message was a useful, generous, and polite response to Saiteja's query. And while his examples were culturally specific, his argument was not.

That said, I suspect the larger reason why Saiteja has not had a technical response to the original query is that few people on openssl-users have experience with using the WPACKET API and other low-level operations in the 1.1 codebase. It still might be worth reposting without the controversial styling.
