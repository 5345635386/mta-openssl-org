<PRE>.

&gt;<i> For your information, I actually tracked down the original report
</I>&gt;<i> about this (and posted some corrections in a comment to the
</I>&gt;<i> researcher):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - This was not HP's keyboard driver.  This was Synaptics' touch
</I>&gt;<i>   pad driver (SynTP.sys).
</I>
Never said it is HP's driver.  But understand, that it only went in to HP machines.

As far as we know.  That, I have said.

&gt;<i> - The code in question was apparently the common classic issue
</I>&gt;<i>   that the driver checks if a hotkey related to the touchpad is
</I>&gt;<i>   pressed, and has a test feature to help each laptop manufacturer
</I>&gt;<i>   check if they configured the correct (laptop-specific) scan code
</I>&gt;<i>   for that hotkey by using a special test driver that logs the keys
</I>&gt;<i>   that match/don't match the configured one.  On a number of
</I>&gt;<i>   occasions HP (and maybe others) have sent such test drivers to end
</I>&gt;<i>   users instead of the drivers without the debug feature.
</I>
A keylogger is not useful in this case, particularly as timing is an acute issue.  At the most basic, when they want what you portray, a utility like evtest.

&gt;<i> - In this case, no keys were logged unless someone (or something)
</I>&gt;<i>   with admin rights on the laptop did extra steps to turn on the
</I>&gt;<i>   feature and to read back the results.  Any malicious code with
</I>&gt;<i>   those rights could just install its own logging without depending
</I>&gt;<i>   on that particular wrong driver being installed,
</I>&gt;<i> -  So to me, that particular issue falls into the less serious tier of:
</I>&gt;<i> Possible misuse if other things go wrong first, upgrade when ready as
</I>&gt;<i> a defense in depth.
</I>&gt;<i> -  Jakob
</I>
Correct, it is not turned on by default.  Never said otherwise.  But it can be manually.

So far I've raised three independent issues in this thread, and have been fought on all three.  I am bored now with trying to raise awareness, so let's just all agree that nobody wants to hear it.  You do your thing and I'll do mine.
