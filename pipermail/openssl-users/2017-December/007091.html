<PRE>Hi All,

Thanks for the inputs, This gives me a good understanding on these ciphers
usage.

Thanks and Regards

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And I would still say that &quot;consult a lawyer&quot; is a useless answer,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> especially as most OpenSSL users will be in the same legal situation,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and lawyers opinions on patent matters are frequently found by courts
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to be wrong anyway.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, I suppose we'll have to disagree on that point. Speaking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hypothetically, if I were the product owner for a commercial software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> product that used OpenSSL, I would most certainly be raising the question
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with corporate counsel.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is a complex and fraught area, and the OpenSSL Foundation is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able (and I'm sure not inclined to try) to indemnify OpenSSL users against
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> infringement claims. To a large extent it doesn't matter what they say. A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> license file in the OpenSSL distribution is not likely to discourage an IP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> owner from claiming infringement if they're so inclined. At that point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;local&quot; lawyers will be involved whether you like it or not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of cause OpenSSL cannot indemnify users.  This is why my actual
</I>&gt;<i> questions to the OpenSSL project were mostly about what 3rd party
</I>&gt;<i> assurances that the project had received and could pass on.  For
</I>&gt;<i> example written patent license statements by Sun/Oracle (in
</I>&gt;<i> conjunction with their 2002 ECC contribution), waivers by
</I>&gt;<i> CertiCom etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even if some companies will want to run everything by their
</I>&gt;<i> corporate council, corporate council can make much more useful
</I>&gt;<i> statements if they can start from some legal documents and
</I>&gt;<i> statements rather than having the lawyers try to pour over C
</I>&gt;<i> code and published patents.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also don't believe that &quot;most OpenSSL users will be in the same legal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> situation&quot;. Here again, patent law is complicated. And more importantly,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well-heeled users are much more likely targets of actual infringement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> claims, which is a very different situation indeed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Point is, that in this global world, most producers are potentially
</I>&gt;<i> exposed in lots of &quot;foreign&quot; jurisdictions, and most corporate
</I>&gt;<i> counsel, while potentially well-heeled in general patent law, are
</I>&gt;<i> unlikely to have specific knowledge of the various patents, licenses
</I>&gt;<i> and waivers applicable to ECC crypto.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Being able to say &quot;we only ship to customers in China and outer Mongolia,
</I>&gt;<i> and under those local laws there is no risk&quot; is a lot rarer than &quot;we ship
</I>&gt;<i> globally except a few problematic destinations, we don't want to be
</I>&gt;<i> hauled to the Eastern district of Texas by Certicom, so we want to
</I>&gt;<i> know if we have contractual assurances that Certicom is OK with using
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL builds that have the ECC code enabled&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That latter situation happens to also be the situation of the OpenSSL
</I>&gt;<i> project itself, except the degree of being a litigation magnet, thus the
</I>&gt;<i> likelihood that the project has obtained some legal documents that can
</I>&gt;<i> be passed on, making no independent promises other than those being true
</I>&gt;<i> and accurate copies of documents signed by their outside authors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Enjoy
