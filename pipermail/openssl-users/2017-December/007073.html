a random local patent lawyer is public answers to the following:

****************************

Answers by the OpenSSL team (I have tried topin this out into easily
answered questions that someone on the team should already know):

- Why is the README.ECC file not included in the regular OpenSSL
 &#160;tarballs?

- Has the OpenSSL project or foundation received any kind of firm legal
 &#160;opinion (or even better a judicial or contractual opinion) as to the
 &#160;question if the license referenced in the README.ECC in the FIPS
 &#160;tarballs applies to the ECC code in the regular OpenSSL tarballs.

- Has the OpenSSL project or foundation received any kind of firm legal
 &#160;opinion (or better) as to the question if the license referenced in
 &#160;FIPS README.ECC applies to non-validated builds of the FIPS tarball
 &#160;(such as modified builds).

- Has the OpenSSL project or foundation received any kind of firm legal
 &#160;opinion (or better) if the license referenced in the FIPS README.ECC
 &#160;applies to uses of the validated FIPS blob in code that does not (and
 &#160;is not in fact) claim to be covered by the FIPS validation (such as a
 &#160;modified OpenSSL that invokes the ECC code in the blob even in
 &#160;non-FIPS mode).

- Is there a technically safe way to copy the ECC code from the FIPS
 &#160;tarball to a build of non-FIPS OpenSSL?

****************************

Answers by Certicom/Blackberry as patent holders (I have split this into
questions that Certicom/Blackberry should be able to easily answer based
on their own policies, except perhaps the first one):

Note that while the answers and questions below may resemble lawsuit
related questions such as &quot;claim construction charts&quot;, it is being asked
outside such context for the purpose of easing compliance with existing
license/sublicense contracts, and to facilitate respect for their
intellectual property, either by acting within granted licenses, obtaining
additional licenses where needed or abstaining from using the patented
technology without a valid license.

As CC/BB may know, OpenSSL is a widely used software library making public
statements a more efficient means of handling this rather than each and
every commercial OpenSSL user entering into near-identical individual
private negotiations.

- Which CC/BB patents (numbers and maybe claims) are applicable to the
 &#160;recent 1.0.2*, 1.1.0* and git head branches?&#160; For clarity, the answers
 &#160;should probably identify specific files and file versions, to protect
 &#160;CC/BB from accidental estoppel regarding the use of additional CC/BB
 &#160;patented technology in files they have not examined.&#160; Note that this
 &#160;answer will probably form the basis for the answers to the questions
 &#160;below.

- Does CC/BB suggest/require that products using any such CC/BB patented
 &#160;technology through the OpenSSL licensing mark their licensed products
 &#160;with&#160;any particular patent notices?

- Does CC/BB demand or not an additional patent license for invocation
of the regular OpenSSL ECC code by the OpenSSL SSL/TLS code in non-FIPS
 &#160;scenarios, if so when and which.

- Does CC/BB demand or not an additional patent license for invocation
 &#160;of the regular OpenSSL ECC code in other scenarios, if so when and which.

- Does CC/BB demand or not an additional patent license for use of the
 &#160;regular OpenSSL ECC code for curves and or algorithms not standardized
 &#160;in the NIST FIPS documents?

Enjoy
