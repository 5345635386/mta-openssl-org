Which would be another variation of such unofficial work.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just because something is past &quot;end of life&quot; does not mean that anyone's ability to use it is revoked.  It just means that keeping it working is their responsibility.  Anyone can use the FOM until it expires (sunsets is the term used), which lasts one year beyond 1.0.2 as I recall.  See <A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2018/05/18/new-lts/">https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2018/05/18/new-lts/</A> for some more information on this.

That policy page is half the problem, the other half being the decision
not to make a FIPS module for the current 1.1.x series.


Enjoy
