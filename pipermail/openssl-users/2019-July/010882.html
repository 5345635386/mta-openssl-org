<PRE>Any help would be much appreciated.
What I want to know is whether SSL_get_fd() can be used to get fd which in turn can be used with getpeername() to know the other host communicating.

Thanks in advance,
Chethan Kumar

Subject: SSL_get_fd

Hi all,

Need an help.
I am trying to print IP address of destination host by doing getpeername() on fd got using SSL_get_fd() in both SSL_accept() and SSL_connect().
Doing SSL_get_fd() fails in SSL_accept() with return value as -1 but its working in SSL_connect().

Can you please help me out in knowing what is the issue.

Thanks in advance,

With Regards,
Chethan Kumar
