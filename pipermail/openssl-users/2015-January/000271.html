So I think I may actually know more or less what's going on, now.

Passing -purpose to `verify` seems to really enable only *purpose* 
checking. It doesn't actually enable any *trust* checking. I was 
thrown for a while because of this, in v3_purp.c:

static X509_PURPOSE xstandard[] = {
        {X509_PURPOSE_SSL_CLIENT, X509_TRUST_SSL_CLIENT, 0, check_purpose_ssl_client, &quot;SSL client&quot;, &quot;sslclient&quot;, NULL},
        {X509_PURPOSE_SSL_SERVER, X509_TRUST_SSL_SERVER, 0, check_purpose_ssl_server, &quot;SSL server&quot;, &quot;sslserver&quot;, NULL},
        {X509_PURPOSE_NS_SSL_SERVER, X509_TRUST_SSL_SERVER, 0, check_purpose_ns_ssl_server, &quot;Netscape SSL server&quot;, &quot;nssslserver&quot;, NULL},
        {X509_PURPOSE_SMIME_SIGN, X509_TRUST_EMAIL, 0, check_purpose_smime_sign, &quot;S/MIME signing&quot;, &quot;smimesign&quot;, NULL},
        {X509_PURPOSE_SMIME_ENCRYPT, X509_TRUST_EMAIL, 0, check_purpose_smime_encrypt, &quot;S/MIME encryption&quot;, &quot;smimeencrypt&quot;, NULL},
        {X509_PURPOSE_CRL_SIGN, X509_TRUST_COMPAT, 0, check_purpose_crl_sign, &quot;CRL signing&quot;, &quot;crlsign&quot;, NULL},
        {X509_PURPOSE_ANY, X509_TRUST_DEFAULT, 0, no_check, &quot;Any Purpose&quot;, &quot;any&quot;, NULL},
        {X509_PURPOSE_OCSP_HELPER, X509_TRUST_COMPAT, 0, ocsp_helper, &quot;OCSP helper&quot;, &quot;ocsphelper&quot;, NULL},
        {X509_PURPOSE_TIMESTAMP_SIGN, X509_TRUST_TSA, 0, check_purpose_timestamp_sign, &quot;Time Stamp signing&quot;, &quot;timestampsign&quot;, NULL},

which clearly associates an X509_TRUST with each X509_PURPOSE. But 
then I noticed that nothing ever calls X509_PURPOSE_get_trust(). So it 
seems like that's kind of vestigial - the association between purpose 
and trust is written in, and there's a function to get the trust for a 
given purpose, but nothing *uses* it.

In my test situation, pure purpose checking will never fail any of the 
certs in the chain for SSL server purposes, and that's not actually 
wrong: they *are* valid as far as the purpose checks go.

When 's_client' fails, it fails when running X509_check_trust() on the 
root cert, which is pretty much what you'd expect. That wouldn't 
happen with 'verify', not even when you pass -purpose , because 
nothing sets a trust from the purpose, so X509_check_trust() never 
gets called in this bit of X509_verify_cert():

        /* The chain extensions are OK: check trust */

        if (param-&gt;trust &gt; 0) ok = check_trust(ctx);

because param-&gt;trust is 0, the default for x509 per the 
'default_table[]' in x509_vpm.c. Right? Whereas when using s_client, 
param-&gt;trust gets set to X509_TRUST_SSL_CLIENT or 
X509_TRUST_SSL_SERVER because those are the defaults for 'ssl_client' 
and 'ssl_server' in default_table[] (and if you traced that back out 
all the way to ssl3_connect(), it seems to always read in the defaults 
for either ssl_client or ssl_server from that table, boy that was fun 
to figure out).

Basically, it seems like you can't ever cause trust checking to happen 
when using 'verify'. I did throw some printf()s into 
X509_check_trust() and check_purpose_ssl_server() and indeed I see 
both sets of messages when using 's_client', but I only see the 
messages from check_purpose_ssl_server() when using 'verify', not the 
ones from X509_check_trust().

(I also now see on a careful read of x509_vfy.c that purpose checks 
are done on all of the untrusted certs in the chain, which is why 
they're not done on the root CA cert, and check_trust() in 1.0.1k is 
run on the last cert in the chain - presumably expected to be the root 
CA - while in master it's run on all trusted certs in the chain. That 
clears up my confusion about exactly what tests were being run on what 
certs).

So, I think I more or less understand the behaviour I'm seeing now, 
and in practice, I *think* it'd be safe to say that p11-kit's approach 
should work correctly in practice, because real-world SSL clients will 
be going through the SSL bits and hence getting a correct default 
'trust' parameter if they don't their own. Right?

I'm guessing perhaps the PURPOSE -&gt; TRUST associations were *intended* 
to enable trust checking in 'verify', but this just never got 
finished. They, and the X509_PURPOSE_get_trust() function, both seem 
to have turned up in commit d4cec6a13dfb2c1d1ddf66dff499aaf21bbbf002 , 
in 1999:




&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New options to the -verify program which can be used for chain verification.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Extend the X509_PURPOSE structure to include shortnames for purposed and default&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;trust ids.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still need some extendable trust checking code and integration with the SSL and&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;S/MIME code.
but I'm guessing that just never quite got finished off?
