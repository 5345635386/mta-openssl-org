But since your minds are made mostly up, let me rephrase the key
communityneeds as I see them:

1. The ability, at any given day, to know which of the currently
available OpenSSLreleases is going to receive back-portable
security patches with binary compatibilityfor at least 3 to 5
years into the future from that day.  A given community member
(such as a Linux distro or a closed source product) will use
this on one of the daysnear the end of their development cycle,
after which they will intend to provideonly small drop in
patches (shared libraries, small programs, binary diffs) for the
lifetime of their &quot;product&quot;.

2. The ability to use libcrypt as the basis for non-SSL code, such
as OpenSSH or theSRP reference impementation (you should coordinate
changes in low level APIswith at least those two teams).  Also
there is the need to use subsets of libcryptwithout the rest, e.g.
in bootloaders or kernels (I don't know if any of the kernel
crypto in Linux or BSD uses OpenSSL code).  And then there is all
the fun securityresearchers are having with the code.

Enjoy
