The output is a bytestring not an integer, so the endianness question is not applicable.  That said, the serialisation of primitive RSA encryption operation results is &quot;big-endian&quot; per various specifications.

You still should not use (or at least treat with great scepticisim) any protocol where you're performing raw RSA encryption operations.
