<PRE>&gt;<i> From: openssl-users &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-users.html">openssl-users-bounces at openssl.org</A>&gt; On Behalf Of Jean Brico

&gt;<i> My CA and my certificates are self-signed (it's for tests, I don't want to use real certificates).
</I>
CA root certificates are self-signed by definition (that's what a &quot;root&quot; certificate is). Certificates issued by a CA are not self-signed, also by definition (that's what it means to be &quot;issued&quot;). So I assume what you mean here is that you have your own CA, not that you're using self-signed entity certificates.

&gt;<i> But under Debian 11, I've some problems: under Chrome, IE, Edge or Firefox on Windows 10
</I>&gt;<i> customer, the results are weird.
</I>
&quot;Weird&quot; is not a useful description.

How is this &quot;customer&quot; system configured for your CA? Did you have them install your root and any intermediates as trusted CA certificates? It's really not clear what you're doing here.

&gt;<i> And if I modify Apache conf to have customer identification, it's even worse.
</I>
I have no idea what you mean by &quot;customer identification&quot; here.

&gt;<i> My question: if curl is working fine, can'I conclude my Apache configuration and my certificates are fine ?
</I>
If you didn't build curl yourself, there's no easy way to know what options were used when compiling it; but I believe by default it does not attempt to validate the peer's certificate chain. You have to use options such as --cacert or --capath to do basic validation, --crlfile to check against a CRL, --cert-status to check OCSP stapling if the peer provides it, and so on.

It's much like openssl s_client: You can use it to do PKIX validation, but it's not automatic. You have to understand what you're doing.

&gt;<i> So the problem is on Chrome, IE, Edge or Firefox on Windows 10 customer, because I use self-certificates 
</I>
It's really not clear *what* you're doing. Supplying copies of your certificates would help.
