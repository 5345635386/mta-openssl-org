    util/find-doc-nits: Better parsing of links
    
    When checking links, we need to peal away stuff that aren't part of
    the link proper first.  That makes it easier to check the link
    itself.

-			HOWTO proxy certificates
-
-0. WARNING
-
-NONE OF THE CODE PRESENTED HERE HAS BEEN CHECKED!  The code is just examples to
-show you how things could be done.  There might be typos or type conflicts, and
-you will have to resolve them.
-
-1. Introduction
-
-Proxy certificates are defined in RFC 3820.  They are really usual certificates
-with the mandatory extension proxyCertInfo.
-
-Proxy certificates are issued by an End Entity (typically a user), either
-directly with the EE certificate as issuing certificate, or by extension through
-an already issued proxy certificate.  Proxy certificates are used to extend
-rights to some other entity (a computer process, typically, or sometimes to the
-user itself).  This allows the entity to perform operations on behalf of the
-owner of the EE certificate.
-
-See <A HREF="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3820.txt">https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3820.txt</A> for more information.
-
-
-2. A warning about proxy certificates
-
-No one seems to have tested proxy certificates with security in mind.  To this
-date, it seems that proxy certificates have only been used in a context highly
-aware of them.
-
-Existing applications might misbehave when trying to validate a chain of
-certificates which use a proxy certificate.  They might incorrectly consider the
-leaf to be the certificate to check for authorisation data, which is controlled
-by the EE certificate owner.
-
-subjectAltName and issuerAltName are forbidden in proxy certificates, and this
-is enforced in OpenSSL.  The subject must be the same as the issuer, with one
-commonName added on.
-
-Possible threats we can think of at this time include:
-
- - impersonation through commonName (think server certificates).
- - use of additional extensions, possibly non-standard ones used in certain
-   environments, that would grant extra or different authorisation rights.
-
-For these reasons, OpenSSL requires that the use of proxy certificates be
-explicitly allowed.  Currently, this can be done using the following methods:
-
- - if the application directly calls X509_verify_cert(), it can first call:
-
-   X509_STORE_CTX_set_flags(ctx, X509_V_FLAG_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS);
-
-   Where ctx is the pointer which then gets passed to X509_verify_cert().
-
- - proxy certificate validation can be enabled before starting the application
-   by setting the environment variable OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS.
-
-In the future, it might be possible to enable proxy certificates by editing
-openssl.cnf.
-
-
-3. How to create proxy certificates
-
-Creating proxy certificates is quite easy, by taking advantage of a lack of
-checks in the 'openssl x509' application (*ahem*).  You must first create a
-configuration section that contains a definition of the proxyCertInfo extension,
-for example:
-
-  [ v3_proxy ]
-  # A proxy certificate MUST NEVER be a CA certificate.
-  basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
-
-  # Usual authority key ID
-  authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer:always
-
-  # The extension which marks this certificate as a proxy
-  proxyCertInfo=critical,language:id-ppl-anyLanguage,pathlen:1,policy:text:AB
-
-It's also possible to specify the proxy extension in a separate section:
-
-  proxyCertInfo=<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">critical, at proxy_ext</A>
-
-  [ proxy_ext ]
-  language=id-ppl-anyLanguage
-  pathlen=0
-  policy=text:BC
-
-The policy value has a specific syntax, {syntag}:{string}, where the syntag
-determines what will be done with the string.  The following syntags are
-recognised:
-
-  text  indicates that the string is simply bytes, without any encoding:
-
-          policy=text:r&#228;ksm&#246;rg&#229;s
-
-        Previous versions of this design had a specific tag for UTF-8 text.
-        However, since the bytes are copied as-is anyway, there is no need for
-        such a specific tag.
-
-  hex   indicates the string is encoded in hex, with colons between each byte
-        (every second hex digit):
-
-          policy=hex:72:E4:6B:73:6D:F6:72:67:E5:73
-
-        Previous versions of this design had a tag to insert a complete DER
-        blob.  However, the only legal use for this would be to surround the
-        bytes that would go with the hex: tag with whatever is needed to
-        construct a correct OCTET STRING.  The DER tag therefore felt
-        superfluous, and was removed.
-
-  file  indicates that the text of the policy should really be taken from a
-        file.  The string is then really a filename.  This is useful for
-        policies that are large (more than a few lines, e.g. XML documents).
-
-The 'policy' setting can be split up in multiple lines like this:
-
-  0.policy=This is
-  1.policy= a multi-
-  2.policy=line policy.
-
-NOTE: the proxy policy value is the part which determines the rights granted to
-the process using the proxy certificate.  The value is completely dependent on
-the application reading and interpreting it!
-
-Now that you have created an extension section for your proxy certificate, you
-can easily create a proxy certificate by doing:
-
-  openssl req -new -config openssl.cnf -out proxy.req -keyout proxy.key
-  openssl x509 -req -CAcreateserial -in proxy.req -days 7 -out proxy.crt \
-    -CA user.crt -CAkey user.key -extfile openssl.cnf -extensions v3_proxy
-
-You can also create a proxy certificate using another proxy certificate as
-issuer (note: I'm using a different configuration section for it):
-
-  openssl req -new -config openssl.cnf -out proxy2.req -keyout proxy2.key
-  openssl x509 -req -CAcreateserial -in proxy2.req -days 7 -out proxy2.crt \
-    -CA proxy.crt -CAkey proxy.key -extfile openssl.cnf -extensions v3_proxy2
-
-
-4. How to have your application interpret the policy?
-
-The basic way to interpret proxy policies is to start with some default rights,
-then compute the resulting rights by checking the proxy certificate against
-the chain of proxy certificates, user certificate and CA certificates. You then
-use the final computed rights.  Sounds easy, huh?  It almost is.
-
-The slightly complicated part is figuring out how to pass data between your
-application and the certificate validation procedure.
-
-You need the following ingredients:
-
- - a callback function that will be called for every certificate being
-   validated.  The callback be called several times for each certificate,
-   so you must be careful to do the proxy policy interpretation at the right
-   time.  You also need to fill in the defaults when the EE certificate is
-   checked.
-
- - a data structure that is shared between your application code and the
-   callback.
-
- - a wrapper function that sets it all up.
-
- - an ex_data index function that creates an index into the generic ex_data
-   store that is attached to an X509 validation context.
-
-Here is some skeleton code you can fill in:
-
-  #include &lt;string.h&gt;
-  #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;
-  #include &lt;openssl/x509.h&gt;
-  #include &lt;openssl/x509v3.h&gt;
-
-  #define total_rights 25
-
-  /*
-   * In this example, I will use a view of granted rights as a bit
-   * array, one bit for each possible right.
-   */
-  typedef struct your_rights {
-      unsigned char rights[(total_rights + 7) / 8];
-  } YOUR_RIGHTS;
-
-  /*
-   * The following procedure will create an index for the ex_data
-   * store in the X509 validation context the first time it's called.
-   * Subsequent calls will return the same index.  */
-  static int get_proxy_auth_ex_data_idx(X509_STORE_CTX *ctx)
-  {
-      static volatile int idx = -1;
-      if (idx &lt; 0) {
-          X509_STORE_lock(X509_STORE_CTX_get0_store(ctx));
-          if (idx &lt; 0) {
-              idx = X509_STORE_CTX_get_ex_new_index(0,
-                                                    &quot;for verify callback&quot;,
-                                                    NULL,NULL,NULL);
-          }
-          X509_STORE_unlock(X509_STORE_CTX_get0_store(ctx));
-      }
-      return idx;
-  }
-
-  /* Callback to be given to the X509 validation procedure.  */
-  static int verify_callback(int ok, X509_STORE_CTX *ctx)
-  {
-      if (ok == 1) {
-          /*
-           * It's REALLY important you keep the proxy policy

+=head1 NAME
+
+proxy-certificates - Proxy certificates in OpenSSL
+
+=head1 DESCRIPTION
+
+Proxy certificates are defined in RFC 3820.  They are used to
+extend rights to some other entity (a computer process, typically, or
+sometimes to the user itself).  This allows the entity to perform
+operations on behalf of the owner of the EE (End Entity) certificate.
+
+The requirements for a valid proxy certificate are:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item *
+
+They are issued by an End Entity, either a normal EE certificate, or
+another proxy certificate.
+
+=item *
+
+They must not have the B&lt;subjectAltName&gt; or B&lt;issuerAltName&gt;
+extensions.
+
+=item *
+
+They must have the B&lt;proxyCertInfo&gt; extension.
+
+=item *
+
+They must have the subject of their issuer, with one B&lt;commonName&gt;
+added.
+
+=back
+
+=head2 Enabling proxy certificate verification
+
+OpenSSL expects applications that want to use proxy certificates to be
+specially aware of them, and make that explicit.  This is done by
+setting an X509 verification flag:
+
+    X509_STORE_CTX_set_flags(ctx, X509_V_FLAG_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS);
+
+or
+
+    X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags(param, X509_V_FLAG_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS);
+
+See L&lt;/NOTES&gt; for a discussion on this requirement.
+
+=head2 Creating proxy certificates
+
+Creating proxy certificates can be done using the L&lt;openssl-x509(1)&gt;
+command, with some extra extensions:
+
+    [ v3_proxy ]
+    # A proxy certificate MUST NEVER be a CA certificate.
+    basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
+
+    # Usual authority key ID
+    authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer:always
+
+    # The extension which marks this certificate as a proxy
+    proxyCertInfo=critical,language:id-ppl-anyLanguage,pathlen:1,policy:text:AB
+
+It's also possible to specify the proxy extension in a separate section:

+    policy=text:BC
+
+The policy value has a specific syntax, I&lt;syntag&gt;:I&lt;string&gt;, where the
+I&lt;syntag&gt; determines what will be done with the string.  The following
+I&lt;syntag&gt;s are recognised:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item B&lt;text&gt;
+
+indicates that the string is a byte sequence, without any encoding:
+
+    policy=text:r&#228;ksm&#246;rg&#229;s
+
+=item B&lt;hex&gt;
+
+indicates the string is encoded hexadecimal encoded binary data, with
+colons between each byte (every second hex digit):
+
+    policy=hex:72:E4:6B:73:6D:F6:72:67:E5:73
+
+=item B&lt;file&gt;
+
+indicates that the text of the policy should be taken from a file.
+The string is then a filename.  This is useful for policies that are
+large (more than a few lines, e.g. XML documents).
+
+=back
+
+I&lt;NOTE: The proxy policy value is what determines the rights granted
+to the process during the proxy certificate.  It's up to the
+application to interpret and combine these policies.&gt;
+
+With a proxy extension, creating a proxy certificate is a matter of
+two commands:
+
+    openssl req -new -config proxy.cnf \
+        -out proxy.req -keyout proxy.key \
+        -subj &quot;/DC=org/DC=openssl/DC=users/CN=proxy 1&quot;
+
+    openssl x509 -req -CAcreateserial -in proxy.req -out proxy.crt \
+        -CA user.crt -CAkey user.key -days 7 \
+        -extfile proxy.cnf -extensions v3_proxy1
+
+You can also create a proxy certificate using another proxy
+certificate as issuer (note: using a different configuration
+section for the proxy extensions):
+
+    openssl req -new -config proxy.cnf \
+        -out proxy2.req -keyout proxy2.key \
+        -subj &quot;/DC=org/DC=openssl/DC=users/CN=proxy 1/CN=proxy 2&quot;
+
+    openssl x509 -req -CAcreateserial -in proxy2.req -out proxy2.crt \
+        -CA proxy.crt -CAkey proxy.key -days 7 \
+        -extfile proxy.cnf -extensions v3_proxy2
+
+=head2 Using proxy certs in applications
+
+To interpret proxy policies, the application would normally start with
+some default rights (perhaps none at all), then compute the resulting
+rights by checking the rights against the chain of proxy certificates,
+user certificate and CA certificates.
+
+The complicated part is figuring out how to pass data between your
+application and the certificate validation procedure.
+
+The following ingredients are needed for such processing:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item *
+
+a callback function that will be called for every certificate being
+validated.  The callback is called several times for each certificate,
+so you must be careful to do the proxy policy interpretation at the
+right time.  You also need to fill in the defaults when the EE
+certificate is checked.
+
+=item *
+
+a data structure that is shared between your application code and the
+callback.
+
+=item *
+
+a wrapper function that sets it all up.
+
+=item *
+
+an ex_data index function that creates an index into the generic
+ex_data store that is attached to an X509 validation context.
+
+=back
+
+The following skeleton code can be used as a starting point:
+
+    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
+    #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;
+    #include &lt;openssl/x509.h&gt;
+    #include &lt;openssl/x509v3.h&gt;
+
+    #define total_rights 25
+
+    /*
+     * In this example, I will use a view of granted rights as a bit
+     * array, one bit for each possible right.
+     */
+    typedef struct your_rights {
+        unsigned char rights[(total_rights + 7) / 8];
+    } YOUR_RIGHTS;
+
+    /*
+     * The following procedure will create an index for the ex_data
+     * store in the X509 validation context the first time it's
+     * called.  Subsequent calls will return the same index.

+
+=head1 NOTES
+
+To this date, it seems that proxy certificates have only been used in
+environments that are aware of them, and no one seems to have
+investigated how they can be used or misused outside of such an
+environment.
+
+For that reason, OpenSSL requires that applications aware of proxy
+certificates must also make that explicit.
+
+B&lt;subjectAltName&gt; and B&lt;issuerAltName&gt; are forbidden in proxy
+certificates, and this is enforced in OpenSSL.  The subject must be
+the same as the issuer, with one commonName added on.
