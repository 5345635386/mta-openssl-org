- NOTES FOR THE WINDOWS PLATFORMS
- ===============================
-
- Windows targets can be classified as &quot;native&quot;, ones that use Windows API
- directly, and &quot;hosted&quot; which rely on POSIX-compatible layer. &quot;Native&quot;
- targets are VC-* (where &quot;VC&quot; stems from abbreviating Microsoft Visual C
- compiler) and mingw[64]. &quot;Hosted&quot; platforms are Cygwin and MSYS[2]. Even
- though the latter is not directly supported by OpenSSL Team, it's #1
- popular choice for building MinGW targets. In the nutshell MinGW builds
- are always cross-compiled. On Linux and Cygwin they look exactly as such
- and require --cross-compile-prefix option. While on MSYS[2] it's solved
- rather by placing gcc that produces &quot;MinGW binary&quot; code 1st on $PATH.
- This is customarily source of confusion. &quot;Hosted&quot; applications &quot;live&quot; in
- emulated file system name space with POSIX-y root, mount points, /dev
- and even /proc. Confusion is intensified by the fact that MSYS2 shell
- (or rather emulated execve(2) call) examines the binary it's about to
- start, and if it's found *not* to be linked with MSYS2 POSIX-y thing,
- command line arguments that look like file names get translated from
- emulated name space to &quot;native&quot;. For example '/c/some/where' becomes
- 'c:\some\where', '/dev/null' - 'nul'. This creates an illusion that
- there is no difference between MSYS2 shell and &quot;MinGW binary&quot;, but
- there is. Just keep in mind that &quot;MinGW binary&quot; &quot;experiences&quot; Windows
- system in exactly same way as one produced by VC, and in its essence
- is indistinguishable from the latter. (Which by the way is why
- it's referred to in quotes here, as &quot;MinGW binary&quot;, it's just as
- &quot;native&quot; as it can get.)

+ NOTES FOR WINDOWS PLATFORMS
+ ===========================
+
+ There are various options to build and run OpenSSL on the Windows platforms.
+
+ &quot;Native&quot; OpenSSL uses the Windows APIs directly at run time.
+ To build a native OpenSSL you can either use:
+
+     Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) C compiler on the command line
+ or
+     MinGW cross compiler
+     run on the GNU-like development environment MSYS2
+     or run on Linux or Cygwin
+
+ &quot;Hosted&quot; OpenSSL relies on an external POSIX compatibility layer
+ for building (using GNU/Unix shell, compiler, and tools) and at run time.
+ For this option you can use Cygwin.

+
+ - Netwide Assembler (NASM), available from <A HREF="https://www.nasm.us">https://www.nasm.us</A>
+   Note that NASM is the only supported assembler.
+
+ Quick start
+ -----------
+
+ 1. Install Perl
+
+ 2. Install NASM
+
+ 3. Make sure both Perl and NASM are on your %PATH%
+
+ 4. Use Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt with administrative privileges,
+    choosing one of its variants depending on the intended architecture.
+    Or run &quot;cmd&quot; and execute &quot;vcvarsall.bat&quot; with one of the options x86,
+    x86_amd64, x86_arm, x86_arm64, amd64, amd64_x86, amd64_arm, or amd64_arm64.
+    This sets up the environment variables needed for nmake.exe, cl.exe, etc.
+    See also <A HREF="https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line">https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line</A>
+
+ 5. From the root of the OpenSSL source directory enter
+    perl Configure VC-WIN32    if you want 32-bit OpenSSL or
+    perl Configure VC-WIN64A   if you want 64-bit OpenSSL
+
+ 6. nmake
 
- - Microsoft Visual C compiler. Since we can't test them all, there is
-   unavoidable uncertainty about which versions are supported. Latest
-   version along with couple of previous are certainly supported. On
-   the other hand oldest one is known not to work. Everything between
-   falls into best-effort category.
+ 7. nmake test
 
- - Netwide Assembler, a.k.a. NASM, available from <A HREF="https://www.nasm.us,">https://www.nasm.us,</A>
-   is required. Note that NASM is the only supported assembler. Even
-   though Microsoft provided assembler is NOT supported, contemporary
-   64-bit version is exercised through continuous integration of
-   VC-WIN64A-masm target.
+ 8. nmake install
 
+ For the full installation instructions, or if anything goes wrong at any stage,
+ check the INSTALL.md file.

+ ================================
 
-   Download MSYS2 from <A HREF="https://msys2.github.io/">https://msys2.github.io/</A> and follow installation
-   instructions. Once up and running install even make, perl, (git if
-   needed,) mingw-w64-i686-gcc and/or mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc. You should
-   have corresponding MinGW items on your start menu, use *them*, not
-   generic MSYS2. As implied in opening note, difference between them
-   is which compiler is found 1st on $PATH. At this point ./config
-   should recognize correct target, roll as if it was Unix...
+ MinGW offers an alternative way to build native OpenSSL, by cross compilation.
 
- * It is also possible to build mingw[64] on Linux or Cygwin by
-   configuring with corresponding --cross-compile-prefix= option. For
-   example
+ * Usually the build is done on Windows in a GNU-like environment called MSYS2.
 
-     ./Configure mingw --cross-compile-prefix=i686-w64-mingw32- ...
+   MSYS2 provides GNU tools, a Unix-like command prompt,
+   and a UNIX compatibility layer for applications.
+   However in this context it is only used for building OpenSSL.
+   The resulting OpenSSL does not rely on MSYS2 to run and is fully native.
+
+   Requirement details
+
+   - MSYS2 shell, from <A HREF="https://www.msys2.org/">https://www.msys2.org/</A>
+
+   - Perl, at least version 5.10.0, which usually comes pre-installed with MSYS2
+
+   - make, installed using &quot;pacman -S make&quot; into the MSYS2 environment
+
+   - MinGW[64] compiler: mingw-w64-i686-gcc and/or mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc.
+     These compilers must be on your MSYS2 $PATH.
+     A common error is to not have these on your $PATH.
+     The MSYS2 version of gcc will not work correctly here.
+
+   In the MSYS2 shell do the configuration depending on the target architecture:
 
+     ./Configure mingw ...
    or
+     ./Configure mingw64 ...
+   or
+     ./config ...
+   for the default architecture.
+
+   Apart from that, follow the Unix / Linux instructions in INSTALL.md.
+
+ * It is also possible to build mingw[64] on Linux or Cygwin.
+
+   In this case configure with the corresponding --cross-compile-prefix= option.
+   For example
 
+     ./Configure mingw --cross-compile-prefix=i686-w64-mingw32- ...
+   or
      ./Configure mingw64 --cross-compile-prefix=x86_64-w64-mingw32- ...
