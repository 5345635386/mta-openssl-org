+
+The `make` variable `TESTS` supports a versatile set of space separated tokens
+with which you can specify a set of tests to be performed.  With a &quot;current
+set of tests&quot; in mind, initially being empty, here are the possible tokens:
+
+     alltests      The current set of tests becomes the whole set of available
+                   tests (as listed when you do 'make list-tests' or similar).
+
+     xxx           Adds the test 'xxx' to the current set of tests.
+
+    -xxx           Removes 'xxx' from the current set of tests.  If this is the
+                   first token in the list, the current set of tests is first
+                   assigned the whole set of available tests, effectively making
+                   this token equivalent to TESTS=&quot;alltests -xxx&quot;.
+
+     nn            Adds the test group 'nn' (which is a number) to the current
+                   set of tests.
+
+    -nn            Removes the test group 'nn' from the current set of tests.
+                   If this is the first token in the list, the current set of
+                   tests is first assigned the whole set of available tests,
+                   effectively making this token equivalent to
+                   TESTS=&quot;alltests -xxx&quot;.
+
+Also, all tokens except for &quot;alltests&quot; may have wildcards, such as *.
+(on Unix and Windows, BSD style wildcards are supported, while on VMS,
+it's VMS style wildcards)
+
+### Examples
+
+Run all tests except for the fuzz tests:
+
+    $ make TESTS=-test_fuzz test
+
+or, if you want to be explicit:
+
+    $ make TESTS='alltests -test_fuzz' test
+
+Run all tests that have a name starting with &quot;test_ssl&quot; but not those
+starting with &quot;test_ssl_&quot;:
+
+    $ make TESTS='test_ssl* -test_ssl_*' test
+
+Run only test group 10:
+
+    $ make TESTS='10'
+
+Run all tests except the slow group (group 99):
+
+    $ make TESTS='-99'
+
+Run all tests in test groups 80 to 99 except for tests in group 90:
+
+    $ make TESTS='[89]? -90'
+
+To stochastically verify that the algorithm that produces uniformly distributed
+random numbers is operating correctly (with a false positive rate of 0.01%):
+
+    $ ./util/wrap.sh test/bntest -stochastic
