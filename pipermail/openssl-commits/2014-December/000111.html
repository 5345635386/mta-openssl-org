+&lt;h2&gt;&lt;center&gt;Last modified 23rd December 2014&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;
+&lt;br&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;As of release 1.0.0 the OpenSSL versioning scheme was improved to
+better meet developers' and vendors' expectations. Letter releases, such as
+1.0.1a, exclusively contain bug and security fixes and no new features.
+Minor releases that change the last digit, e.g. 1.0.1 vs. 1.0.2, can and
+are likely to contain new features, but in a way that does not break
+binary compatibility. This means that an application compiled and
+dynamically linked with 1.0.0 does not need to be recompiled when the shared
+library is updated to 1.0.2. It should be noted that some features are
+transparent to the application such as the maximum negotiated TLS version and
+cipher suites, performance improvements and so on. There is no need to recompile
+applications to benefit from these features.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Binary compatibility also allows other possibilities. For example, consider an
+application that wishes to utilize a new cipher provided in a specific 1.0.x
+release, but it is also desirable to maintain the application in a 1.0.0 context.
+Customarily this would be resolved at compile time resulting in two binary
+packages targeting different OpenSSL versions. However, depending on the feature,
+it might be possible to check for its availability at run-time, thus cutting
+down on the maintenance of multiple binary packages. Admittedly it takes a certain
+discipline and some extra coding, but we would like to encourage such
+practice. This is because we want to see later releases being adopted
+faster, because new features can improve security.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;With regards to current and future releases the OpenSSL project has adopted the
+following policy:&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;ul&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for version 0.9.8 will cease on 2015-12-31. No further releases of 0.9.8
+will be made after that date. Security fixes only will be applied to 0.9.8 until
+then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
+
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for version 1.0.0 will cease on 2015-12-31. No further releases of 1.0.0
+will be made after that date. Security fixes only will be applied to 1.0.0 until
+then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;/ul&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;We may designate a release as a Long Term Support (LTS) release. LTS releases
+will be supported for at least five years and we will specify one at least every
+four years. Non-LTS releases will be supported for at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;As implied by the above paragraphs, during the final year of support, we do not
+commit to anything other than security fixes. Before that, bug and security
+fixes will be applied as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;ul&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Version 1.0.1 will be supported until 2016-12-31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
+
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Version 1.0.2 will be supported until at least 2016-12-31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;/ul&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;At this time, we are not planning a 1.0.3 release.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Version 1.1.0 will (moderately) break source compatibility (for example we will
+make most structures opaque etc). We expect a preview version to be available
+mid 2015, with an expected release by the end of 2015. Preview means that we are
+not planning or expecting major API changes between the preview release and the
+final release (but are not categorically precluding that possibility).&lt;/p&gt;
