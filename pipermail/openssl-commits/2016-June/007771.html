+ Environment Variables
+ ---------------------
+
+ A number of environment variables can be used to provide additional control
+ over the build process. Typically these should be defined prior to running
+ config or Configure. Not all environment variables are relevant to all
+ platforms.
+
+ AR
+                The name of the ar executable to use.
+
+ CC
+                The compiler to use. Configure will attempt to pick a default
+                compiler for your platform but this choice can be overridden
+                using this variable. Set it to the compiler executable you wish
+                to use, e.g. &quot;gcc&quot; or &quot;clang&quot;.
+
+ CROSS_COMPILE
+                This environment variable has the same meaning as for the
+                &quot;--cross-compile-prefix&quot; Configure flag described above. If both
+                are set then the Configure flag takes precedence.
+
+ NM
+                The name of the nm executable to use.
+
+ OPENSSL_LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR
+                OpenSSL comes with a database of information about how it
+                should be built on different platforms. This information is
+                held in &quot;.conf&quot; files in the Configurations directory. See the
+                file Configurations/README for further information about the
+                format of &quot;.conf&quot; files. As well as the standard &quot;.conf&quot; files
+                it is possible to create your own &quot;.conf&quot; files and store them
+                locally, outside the OpenSSL source tree. This environment
+                variable can be set to the directory where these files are held.
+
+ PERL
+                The name of the Perl executable to use.
+
+ RC
+                The name of the rc executable to use. The default will be as
+                defined for the target platform in the &quot;.conf&quot; file. If not
+                defined then &quot;windres&quot; will be used. The WINDRES environment
+                variable is synonymous to this. If both are defined then RC
+                takes precedence.
+
+ RANLIB
+                The name of the ranlib executable to use.
+
+ WINDRES
+                See RC.
+
+ Makefile targets
+ ----------------
+
+ The Configure script generates a Makefile in a format relevant to the specific
+ platform. The Makefiles provide a number of targets that can be used. Not all
+ targets may be available on all platforms. Only the most common targets are
+ described here. Examine the Makefiles themselves for the full list.
+
+ all
+                The default target to build all the software components.
+
+ clean
+                Remove all build artefacts and return the directory to a &quot;clean&quot;
+                state.
+
+ depend
+                Rebuild the dependencies in the Makefiles. This is a legacy
+                option that no longer needs to be used in OpenSSL 1.1.0.
+
+ install
+                Install all OpenSSL components.
+
+ install_sw
+                Only install the OpenSSL software components.
+
+ install_docs
+                Only install the OpenSSL documentation components.
+
+ install_man_docs
+                Only install the OpenSSL man pages (Unix only).
+
+ install_html_docs
+                Only install the OpenSSL html documentation.
+
+ list-tests
+                Prints a list of all the self test names.
+
+ test
+                Build and run the OpenSSL self tests.
+
+ uninstall
+                Uninstall all OpenSSL components.
+
+ update
+                This is a developer option. If you are developing a patch for
+                OpenSSL you may need to use this if you want to update
+                automatically generated files; add new error codes or add new
