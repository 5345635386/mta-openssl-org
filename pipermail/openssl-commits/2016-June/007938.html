    Document the issue with threads and dlopen()
    
    If using threads and OpenSSL is loaded via dlopen(), and subsequently
    closed again via dlclose() *before* the threads are destroyed, then
    OpenSSL will not free up the per thread resources. We need to document
    this restriction, and provide some guidance on what to do about it.
    
    I did some testing and discovered/verified a few of things (at least
    this is the behaviour on Linux):
    
    - Using OpenSSL via dlopen in a mutli-threaded app does leak memory if
    threads are destroyed after dlcose() is called.
    - In a single threaded environment, or if threads are destroyed prior to
    dlclose() being called, then no memory is leaked
    - Using the RTLD_NODELETE flag to dlopen solves the above problem
    - Interestingly the OpenSSL atexit() handler gets called when dlclose()
    is called rather than at application exit (I was worred that it might crash
    if there was an atexit() handler for a function that has been unloaded)
    - RTLD_NODELETE is a non-standard flag - but it does seem to be fairly
    widely supported. As far as I could determine (via google), at least Linux,
    Solaris, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, HP-UX all seem to support it.
    
    I also tested on Windows (using LoadLibrary instead of dlopen and
    FreeLibrary instead of dlclose) and experienced similar behaviour, except
    that (AFAIK) there is no equivalent of RTLD_NODELETE on Windows.
