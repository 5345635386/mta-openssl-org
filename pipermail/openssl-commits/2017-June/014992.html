 It was decided after the release of OpenSSL 0.9.8y the next version should
 be 0.9.8za then 0.9.8zb and so on.
-
-The current version is available from @@@<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org@@@.">https://www.openssl.org@@@.</A>
-
-In addition to the current stable release, you can also access daily
-snapshots of the OpenSSL development version at 
-@@@<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/source/snapshot/@@@,">https://www.openssl.org/source/snapshot/@@@,</A> or get
-it by anonymous Git access.
-
-* Where is the documentation?
-
-OpenSSL is a library that provides cryptographic functionality to
-applications such as secure web servers.  Be sure to read the
-documentation of the application you want to use.  The INSTALL file
-explains how to install this library.
-
-OpenSSL includes a command line utility that can be used to perform a
-variety of cryptographic functions.  It is described in the openssl(1)
-manpage.  Documentation for developers is currently being written. Many
-manual pages are available; overviews over libcrypto and
-libssl are given in the crypto(7)
-and ssl(7) manpages.
-
-The OpenSSL manpages are installed in /usr/local/ssl/man/ (or a
-different directory if you specified one as described in INSTALL).
-In addition, you can read the most current versions at
-@@@<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/docs/@@@.">https://www.openssl.org/docs/@@@.</A> Note that the online documents refer
-to the very latest development versions of OpenSSL and may include features
-not present in released versions. If in doubt refer to the documentation
-that came with the version of OpenSSL you are using. The pod format
-documentation is included in each OpenSSL distribution under the docs
-directory.
-
-* How can I contact the OpenSSL developers?
-
-The README file describes how to submit bug reports and patches to
-OpenSSL.  Information on the OpenSSL mailing lists is available from
-@@@<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/community/mailinglists.html@@@.">https://www.openssl.org/community/mailinglists.html@@@.</A>
-
-* Where can I get a compiled version of OpenSSL?
-
-You can finder pointers to binary distributions in
-@@@<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/community/binaries.html@@@.">https://www.openssl.org/community/binaries.html@@@.</A>
-
-Some applications that use OpenSSL are distributed in binary form.
-When using such an application, you don't need to install OpenSSL
-yourself; the application will include the required parts (e.g. DLLs).
-
-If you want to build OpenSSL on a Windows system and you don't have
-a C compiler, read the &quot;Mingw32&quot; section of INSTALL.W32 for information
-on how to obtain and install the free GNU C compiler.
-
-A number of Linux and *BSD distributions include OpenSSL.
-
-* Why aren't tools like 'autoconf' and 'libtool' or 'cmake' used?
-
-A number of these tools are great and wonderful, but are usually
-centered around one or a few platforms.  'autoconf' and 'libtool' are
-Unix centric.  'cmake' is a bit more widely spread, but not enough to
-cover the platforms we support.
-
-For OpenSSL 1.1, we decided to base our build system on perl,
-information files and build file (Makefile) templates, thereby
-covering all the systems we support.  Perl was the base language of
-choice because we already use it in diverse scripts, and it's one of
-the most widely spread scripting languages.
-
-* What is an 'engine' version?
-
-With version 0.9.6 OpenSSL was extended to interface to external crypto
-hardware. This was realized in a special release '0.9.6-engine'. With
-version 0.9.7 the changes were merged into the main development line,
-so that the special release is no longer necessary.
-
-* How do I check the authenticity of the OpenSSL distribution?
-
-We provide PGP signatures and a variety of digests on each release.
-For example, one of the following might work on your system:
-
-&lt;PRE&gt;
-    sha1sum TARBALL | awk '{print $1;}' | cmp - TARBALL.sha1
-    sha256sum TARBALL | awk '{print $1;}' | cmp - TARBALL.sha256
-&lt;/PRE&gt;
-
-You can check authenticity using pgp or gpg. You need the OpenSSL OMC
-member public key used to sign it (download it from a key server or see a
-list of keys at @@@<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/community/omc.html@@@">https://www.openssl.org/community/omc.html@@@</A>). Then
-just do:
-
-&lt;PRE&gt;
-    pgp TARBALL.asc
-&lt;/PRE&gt;
-
-* How does the versioning scheme work?
-
-After the release of OpenSSL 1.0.0 the versioning scheme changed. Letter
-releases (e.g. 1.0.1a) can only contain bug and security fixes and no
-new features. Minor releases change the last number (e.g. 1.0.2) and
-can contain new features that retain binary compatibility. Changes to
-the middle number are considered major releases and neither source nor
-binary compatibility is guaranteed.
-
-Therefore the answer to the common question &quot;when will feature X be
-backported to OpenSSL 1.0.0/0.9.8?&quot; is &quot;never&quot; but it could appear
-in the next minor release.
-
-* What happens when the letter release reaches z?
-
-It was decided after the release of OpenSSL 0.9.8y the next version should
-be 0.9.8za then 0.9.8zb and so on.
