    Remove FAQ about SGC and step-up certs
    
    These are not typically used any more.

 has however been left as default for the sake of compatibility.
 
-* What is a &quot;128 bit certificate&quot;? Can I create one with OpenSSL?
-
-The term &quot;128 bit certificate&quot; is a highly misleading marketing term. It does
-not refer to the size of the public key in the certificate! A certificate
-containing a 128 bit RSA key would have negligible security.
-
-There were various other names such as &quot;magic certificates&quot;, &quot;SGC
-certificates&quot;, &quot;step up certificates&quot; etc.
-
-You can't generally create such a certificate using OpenSSL but there is no
-need to any more. Nowadays web browsers using unrestricted strong encryption
-are generally available.
-
-When there were tight restrictions on the export of strong encryption
-software from the US only weak encryption algorithms could be freely exported
-(initially 40 bit and then 56 bit). It was widely recognised that this was
-inadequate. A relaxation of the rules allowed the use of strong encryption but
-only to an authorised server.
-
-Two slightly different techniques were developed to support this, one used by
-Netscape was called &quot;step up&quot;, the other used by MSIE was called &quot;Server Gated
-Cryptography&quot; (SGC). When a browser initially connected to a server it would
-check to see if the certificate contained certain extensions and was issued by
-an authorised authority. If these test succeeded it would reconnect using
-strong encryption.
-
-Only certain (initially one) certificate authorities could issue the
-certificates and they generally cost more than ordinary certificates.
-
-Although OpenSSL can create certificates containing the appropriate extensions
-the certificate would not come from a permitted authority and so would not
-be recognized.
-
-The export laws were later changed to allow almost unrestricted use of strong
-encryption so these certificates are now obsolete.
-
 * Why does OpenSSL set the authority key identifier (AKID) extension incorrectly?
 
 It doesn't: this extension is often the cause of confusion.
