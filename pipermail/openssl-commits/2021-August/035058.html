+=item SSL_OP_ENABLE_KTLS
 
-When using stateless session tickets the server uses a session ticket encryption
-key to encrypt the session information. This encrypted data is sent to the
-client as a &quot;ticket&quot;. When the client wishes to resume it sends the encrypted
-data back to the server. The server uses its key to decrypt the data and resume
-the session. In this way the server can operate statelessly - no session
-information needs to be cached locally.
+Enable the use of kernel TLS. In order to benefit from kernel TLS OpenSSL must
+have been compiled with support for it, and it must be supported by the
+negotiated ciphersuites and extensions. The specific ciphersuites and extensions
+that are supported may vary by platform and kernel version.
 
-The TLSv1.3 protocol only supports tickets and does not directly support session
-ids. However, OpenSSL allows two modes of ticket operation in TLSv1.3: stateful
-and stateless. Stateless tickets work the same way as in TLSv1.2 and below.
-Stateful tickets mimic the session id behaviour available in TLSv1.2 and below.
-The session information is cached on the server and the session id is wrapped up
-in a ticket and sent back to the client. When the client wishes to resume, it
-presents a ticket in the same way as for stateless tickets. The server can then
-extract the session id from the ticket and retrieve the session information from
-its cache.
+The kernel TLS data-path implements the record layer, and the encryption
+algorithm. The kernel will utilize the best hardware
+available for encryption. Using the kernel data-path should reduce the memory
+footprint of OpenSSL because no buffering is required. Also, the throughput
+should improve because data copy is avoided when user data is encrypted into
+kernel memory instead of the usual encrypt then copy to kernel.
 
-By default OpenSSL will use stateless tickets. The SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option will
-cause stateless tickets to not be issued. In TLSv1.2 and below this means no
-ticket gets sent to the client at all. In TLSv1.3 a stateful ticket will be
-sent. This is a server-side option only.
+Kernel TLS might not support all the features of OpenSSL. For instance,
+renegotiation, and setting the maximum fragment size is not possible as of
+Linux 4.20.
 
-In TLSv1.3 it is possible to suppress all tickets (stateful and stateless) from
-being sent by calling L&lt;SSL_CTX_set_num_tickets(3)&gt; or
-L&lt;SSL_set_num_tickets(3)&gt;.
+Note that with kernel TLS enabled some cryptographic operations are performed
+by the kernel directly and not via any available OpenSSL Providers. This might
+be undesirable if, for example, the application requires all cryptographic
+operations to be performed by the FIPS provider.
