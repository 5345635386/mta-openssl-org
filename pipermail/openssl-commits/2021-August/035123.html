+OpenSSL Security Advisory [24 August 2021]
+==========================================
+
+SM2 Decryption Buffer Overflow (CVE-2021-3711)
+==============================================
+
+Severity: High
+
+In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the
+API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this
+function twice. The first time, on entry, the &quot;out&quot; parameter can be NULL and,
+on exit, the &quot;outlen&quot; parameter is populated with the buffer size required to
+hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently
+sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL
+value for the &quot;out&quot; parameter.
+
+A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the
+calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the
+first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by
+the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is
+called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small.
+
+A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an
+application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a
+maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the
+buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to
+crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically
+heap allocated.
+
+OpenSSL versions 1.1.1k and below are affected by this issue. Users of these
+versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1l.
+
+OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.
+
+OpenSSL 3.0 alpha/beta releases are also affected but this issue will be
+addressed before the final release.
+
+This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 12th August 2021 by John Ouyang. The fix
+was developed by Matt Caswell.
+
+Read buffer overruns processing ASN.1 strings (CVE-2021-3712)
+=============================================================
+
+Severity: Moderate
+
+ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING
+structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding
+the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as
+a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte.
+
+Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's
+own &quot;d2i&quot; functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string
+whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally
+NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure.
+
+However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING
+structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the
+&quot;data&quot; and &quot;length&quot; fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by
+using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function.
+
+Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that
+the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not
+guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application
+requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure
+contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application
+without NUL terminating the &quot;data&quot; field, then a read buffer overrun can occur.
+
+The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates
+(for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application
+instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate
+contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the
+X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions.
+
+If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an
+ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions
+then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of
+Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory
+contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).
+
+OpenSSL versions 1.1.1k and below are affected by this issue. Users of these
+versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1l.
+
+OpenSSL versions 1.0.2y and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL
+1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support
+customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2za. Other users should upgrade
+to 1.1.1l.
+
+An initial instance of this issue in the X509_aux_print() function was reported
+to OpenSSL on 18th July 2021 by Ingo Schwarze. The bugfix was developed by Ingo
+Schwarze and first publicly released in OpenBSD-current on 10th July 2021 and
+subsequently in OpenSSL on 20th July 2021 (commit d9d838ddc). Subsequent
+analysis by David Benjamin on 17th August 2021 identified more instances of the
+same bug. Additional analysis was performed by Matt Caswell. Fixes for the
+additional instances of this issue were developed by Matt Caswell.
+
+Note
+====
+
+OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Extended
+support is available for premium support customers:
+<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html">https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html</A>
+
+OpenSSL 1.1.0 is out of support and no longer receiving updates of any kind.
+The impact of these issues on OpenSSL 1.1.0 has not been analysed.
+
+Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1.
