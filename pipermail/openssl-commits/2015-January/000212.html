      Verify that we have a sensible message len and fail if not     RT#3592 provides an instance where the OPENSSL_assert that this commit     replaces can be hit. I was able to recreate this issue by forcing the     underlying BIO to misbehave and come back with very small mtu values. This     happens the second time around the while loop after we have detected that the     MTU has been exceeded following the call to dtls1_write_bytes.
      The SSL_OP_NO_QUERY_MTU option is supposed to stop the mtu from being     automatically updated, and we should use the one provided instead.     Unfortunately there are a couple of locations where this is not respected.
      The first call to query the mtu in dtls1_do_write correctly checks that the     mtu that we have received is not less than the minimum. If its less it uses the     minimum instead. The second call to query the mtu does not do that, but     instead uses whatever comes back. We have seen an instance in RT#3592 where we     have got an unreasonably small mtu come back. This commit makes both query     checks consistent.
      There are a number of instances throughout the code where the constant 28 is     used with no explanation. Some of this was introduced as part of RT#1929. The     value 28 is the length of the IP header (20 bytes) plus the UDP header (8     bytes). However use of this constant is incorrect because there may be     instances where a different value is needed, e.g. an IPv4 header is 20 bytes     but an IPv6 header is 40. Similarly you may not be using UDP (e.g. SCTP).     This commit introduces a new BIO_CTRL that provides the value to be used for     this mtu &quot;overhead&quot;. It will be used by subsequent commits.
      Remove instances in libssl of the constant 28 (for size of IPv4 header + UDP)     and instead use the value provided by the underlying BIO. Also provide some     new DTLS_CTRLs so that the library user can set the mtu without needing to     know this constant. These new DTLS_CTRLs provide the capability to set the     link level mtu to be used (i.e. including this IP/UDP overhead). The previous     DTLS_CTRLs required the library user to subtract this overhead first.
      Fix dtls_query_mtu so that it will always either complete with an mtu that is     at least the minimum or it will fail.     There were some instances in dtls1_query_mtu where the final mtu can end up     being less than the minimum, i.e. where the user has set an mtu manually. This     shouldn't be allowed. Also remove dtls1_guess_mtu that, despite having     logic for guessing an mtu, was actually only ever used to work out the minimum     mtu to use.
      If we really get a situation where the underlying mtu is less than the minimum     we will support then dtls1_do_write can go into an infinite loop. This commit     fixes that.
      Updates to s_client and s_server to remove the constant 28 (for IPv4 header     and UDP header) when setting an mtu. This constant is not always correct (e.g.     if using IPv6). Use the new DTLS_CTRL functions instead.
      Only use the fallback mtu after 2 unsuccessful retransmissions if it is less     than the mtu we are already using
      Remove &quot;#if 0&quot; code
      Remove incorrect code inadvertently introduced through commit 59669b6ab.
      Fix memory leak in SSL_new if errors occur.
      Fixed memory leak in the event of a failure of BUF_MEM_grow
      Fix use of NULL memory pointer in X509_VERIFY_PARAM_new in the event of a     malloc failure.
      Fixed memory leak if BUF_MEM_grow fails
      Fix memory leak in s2_srvr.c if BUF_MEM_grow fails
      Check return value of ssl3_output_cert_chain
      Checkout return value of dtls1_output_cert_chain
      DTLS fixes for signed/unsigned issues
      Remove extraneous white space, and add some braces
      Add OPENSSL_NO_ECDH guards
      Fix a problem if CFLAGS is too long cversion.c fails to compile when config     is run with --strict-warnings.
      Remove blank line from start of cflags character array in buildinf.h
      Follow on from CVE-2014-3571. This fixes the code that was the original source     of the crash due to p being NULL. Steve's fix prevents this situation from     occuring - however this is by no means obvious by looking at the code for     dtls1_get_record. This fix just makes things look a bit more sane.
      A memory leak can occur in dtls1_buffer_record if either of the calls to     ssl3_setup_buffers or pqueue_insert fail. The former will fail if there is a     malloc failure, whilst the latter will fail if attempting to add a duplicate     record to the queue. This should never happen because duplicate records should     be detected and dropped before any attempt to add them to the queue.     Unfortunately records that arrive that are for the next epoch are not being     recorded correctly, and therefore replays are not being detected.     Additionally, these &quot;should not happen&quot; failures that can occur in     dtls1_buffer_record are not being treated as fatal and therefore an attacker     could exploit this by sending repeated replay records for the next epoch,     eventually causing a DoS through memory exhaustion.
