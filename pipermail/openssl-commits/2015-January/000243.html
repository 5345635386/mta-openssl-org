+                OpenSSL coding style
+
+This document describes the coding style for the OpenSSL project. It is
+is derived from the Linux kernel coding style, which can be found at:
+
+    <A HREF="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle">https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle</A>
+
+This Coding Style guide is not distributed as part of OpenSSL itself. Since
+it is derived from the Linux Kernel Coding Style, it is distributed under
+the terms of the kernel license, available here:
+
+    <A HREF="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/COPYING">https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/COPYING</A>
+
+Coding style is all about readability and maintainability using commonly
+available tools. OpenSSL coding style is simple. Avoid tricky expressions.
+
+
+                Chapter 1: Indentation
+
+Indentation is four space characters. Do not use the tab character.
+
+Pre-processor directives use one space for indents:
+
+    #if
+    # define
+    #else
+    # define
+    #endif
+
+
+                Chapter 2: Breaking long lines and strings
+
+Don't put multiple statements, or assignments, on a single line.
+
+    if (condition) do_this();
+    do_something_everytime();
+
+The limit on the length of lines is 80 columns. Statements longer
+than 80 columns must be broken into sensible chunks, unless exceeding
+80 columns significantly increases readability and does not hide
+information. Descendants are always substantially shorter than the parent
+and are placed substantially to the right. The same applies to function
+headers with a long argument list. Never break user-visible strings,
+however, because that breaks the ability to grep for them.
+
+
+                Chapter 3: Placing Braces and Spaces
+
+The other issue that always comes up in C styling is the placement
+of braces. Unlike the indent size, there are few technical reasons to
+choose one placement strategy over the other, but the preferred way,
+following Kernighan and Ritchie, is to put the opening brace last on the
+line, and the closing brace first:
+
+    if (x is true) {
+        we do y
+    }
+
+This applies to all non-function statement blocks (if, switch, for,
+while, do):
+
+    switch (suffix) {
+    case 'G':
+    case 'g':
+        mem &lt;&lt;= 30;
+        break;
+    case 'M':
+    case 'm':
+        mem &lt;&lt;= 20;
+        break;
+    case 'K':
+    case 'k':
+        mem &lt;&lt;= 10;
+        /* fall through */
+    default:
+        break;
+    }
+
+Note, from the above example, that the way to indent a switch statement
+is to align the switch and its subordinate case labels in the same column
+instead of &quot;double-indenting&quot; the case bodies.
+
+There is one special case, however. Functions have the
+opening brace at the beginning of the next line:
+
+    int function(int x)
+    {
+        body of function
+    }
+
+Note that the closing brace is empty on a line of its own, EXCEPT in the
+cases where it is followed by a continuation of the same statement, such
+as a &quot;while&quot; in a do-statement or an &quot;else&quot; in an if-statement, like this:
+
+    do {
+        ...
+    } while (condition);
+
+and
+
+    if (x == y) {
+        ...
+    } else if (x &gt; y) {
+        ...
+    } else {
+        ...
+    }
+
+In addition to being consistent with K&amp;R, note that that this brace-placement
+also minimizes the number of empty (or almost empty) lines. Since the
+supply of new-lines on your screen is not a renewable resource (think
+25-line terminal screens here), you have more empty lines to put comments on.
+
+Do not unnecessarily use braces around a single statement:
+
+    if (condition)
+        action();
+
+and
+
+    if (condition)
+        do_this();
+    else
+        do_that();
+
+If one of the branches is a compound statement, then use braces on both parts:
+
+    if (condition) {
+        do_this();
+        do_that();
+    } else {
+        otherwise();
+    }
+
+Nested compound statements should often have braces for clarity, particularly
+to avoid the dangling-else problem:
+
+    if (condition) {
+        do_this();
+        if (anothertest)
+            do_that();
+    } else {
+        otherwise();
+    }
+
+
+                Chapter 3.1:  Spaces
+
+OpenSSL style for use of spaces depends (mostly) on whether the name is
+a function or keyword. Use a space after most keywords:
+
+    if, switch, case, for, do, while, return
+
+Do not use a space after sizeof, typeof, alignof, or __attribute__.
+They look somewhat like functions and are usually used with parentheses
+in OpenSSL, although they are not required in the language:
+
+    s = sizeof(struct file);
+
+Do not add spaces around the inside of parenthesized expressions.
+This example is wrong:
+
+    s = sizeof( struct file );
+
+When declaring pointer data or a function that returns a pointer type, the
+the asterisk goes next to the data or function name, and not the type:
+
+    char *openssl_banner;
+    unsigned long long memparse(char *ptr, char **retptr);
+    char *match_strdup(substring_t *s);
+
+Use one space on either side of binary and ternary operators,
+such as this partial list:
+
+    =  +  -  &lt;  &gt;  *  /  %  |  &amp;  ^  &lt;=  &gt;=  ==  !=  ?  : +=
+
+Do not put a space after unary operators:
+
+    &amp;  *  +  -  ~  !  defined
+
+Do not put a space before the postfix increment and decrement unary
+operators or after the prefix increment and decrement unary operators:
+
+    foo++
+    --bar
+
+Do not put a space around the '.' and &quot;-&gt;&quot; structure member operators:
+    foo.bar
+    foo-&gt;bar
+
+Do not leave trailing whitespace at the ends of lines. Some editors with
+&quot;smart&quot; indentation will insert whitespace at the beginning of new lines
+as appropriate, so you can start typing the next line of code right away.
+But they may not remove that whitespace if you leave a blank line, however,
+and you end up with lines containing trailing, or nothing but, whitespace.
+
+Git will warn you about patches that introduce trailing whitespace, and
+can optionally strip the trailing whitespace; however, if applying
+a series of patches, this may make later patches in the series fail by
+changing their context lines.
+
+
+                Chapter 4: Naming
+
+C is a Spartan language, and so should your naming be. Do not use long
+names like ThisVariableIsATemporaryCounter. Use a name like tmp, which
+is much easier to write, and not more difficult to understand.
+
+Except when otherwise required, avoid mixed-case names.
+
+Do not encode the type into a name (so-called Hungarian notation).
+
+Global variables (to be used only if you REALLY need them) need to
+have descriptive names, as do global functions. If you have a function
+that counts the number of active users, you should call that
+count_active_users() or similar, you should NOT call it cntusr().
+
+Local variable names should be short, and to the point. If you have
+some random integer loop counter, it should probably be called i.
+Calling it loop_counter is non-productive, if there is no chance of it
+being mis-understood. Similarly, tmp can be just about any type of
+variable that is used to hold a temporary value.
+
+If you are afraid that someone might mix up your local variable names,
+perhaps the function is too long; see Chapter 6.
+
+
+                Chapter 5: Typedefs
+
+OpenSSL uses typedef's extensively. For structures, they are all uppercase
+and are usually declared like this:
+
+    typedef struct name_st NAME;
+
+For examples, look in ossl_type.h, but note that there are many exceptions
+such as BN_CTX. Typedef'd enum is used much less often and there is no
+convention, so consider not using a typedef. When doing that, the enum
+name is should be lowercase and the values (mostly) uppercase.
+
+The ASN.1 structures are an exception to this. The rationale is that if
+a structure (and its fields) is already defined in a standard it's more
+convenient to use a similar name. For example, in the CMS code, a CMS_
+prefix is used so ContentInfo becomes CMS_ContentInfo, RecipientInfo
+becomes CMS_RecipientInfo etc. Some older code uses an all uppercase
+name instead. For example, RecipientInfo for the PKCS#7 code uses
+PKCS7_RECIP_INFO.
+
+Be careful about common names which might cause conflicts. For example,
+Windows headers use X509 and X590_NAME. Consider using a prefix, as with
+CMS_ContentInfo, if the name is common or generic. Of course, you often
+don't find out until the code is ported to other platforms.
+
+A final word on struct's. OpenSSL has has historically made all struct
+definitions public; this has caused problems with maintaining binary
+compatibility and adding features. Our stated direction is to have struct's
+be opaque and only expose pointers in the API. The actual struct definition
+should be defined in a local header file that is not exported.
+
+
+                Chapter 6: Functions
+
+Ideally, functions should be short and sweet, and do just one thing.
+A rule of thumb is that they should fit on one or two screenfuls of text
+as we all know), and do one thing and do that well.
+
+The maximum length of a function is often inversely proportional to the
+complexity and indentation level of that function. So, if you have a
+conceptually simple function that is just one long (but simple) switch
+statement, where you have to do lots of small things for a lot of different
+cases, it's OK to have a longer function.
+
+If you have a complex function, however, consider using helper functions
+with descriptive names. You can ask the compiler to in-line them if you
+think it's performance-critical, and it will probably do a better job of
+it than you would have done.
+
+Another measure of complexity is the number of local variables. If there are
+more than five to 10, consider splitting it into smaller pieces. A human
+brain can generally easily keep track of about seven different things,
+anything more and it gets confused. Often things which are simple and
+clear now are much less obvious two weeks from now, or to someone else.
+An exception to this is the command-line applications which support many
+options.
+
+In source files, separate functions with one blank line.
+
+In function prototypes, include parameter names with their data types.
+Although this is not required by the C language, it is preferred in OpenSSL
+because it is a simple way to add valuable information for the reader.
+The name in the prototype declaration should match the name in the function
+definition.
+
+
+                Chapter 7: Centralized exiting of functions
+
+The goto statement comes in handy when a function exits from multiple
+locations and some common work such as cleanup has to be done. If there
+is no cleanup needed then just return directly. The rationale for this is
+as follows:
+
+    - Unconditional statements are easier to understand and follow
+    - It can reduce excessive control structures and nesting
+    - It avoids errors caused by failing to updated multiple exit points
+      when the code is modified
+    - It saves the compiler work to optimize redundant code away ;)
+
+For example:
+
+    int fun(int a)
+    {
+        int result = 0;
+        char *buffer = OPENSSL_malloc(SIZE);
+
+        if (buffer == NULL)
+            return -1;
+
+        if (condition1) {
+            while (loop1) {
+                ...
+            }
+            result = 1;
+            goto out;
+        }
+        ...
+    out:
+        OPENSSL_free(buffer);
+        return result;
+    }
+
+                Chapter 8: Commenting
+
+Use the classic &quot;/* ... */&quot; comment markers.  Don't use &quot;// ...&quot; markers.
+
+Comments are good, but there is also a danger of over-commenting. NEVER try
+to explain HOW your code works in a comment. It is much better to write
+the code so that it is obvious, and it's a waste of time to explain badly
+written code. You want your comments to tell WHAT your code does, not HOW.
+
+The preferred style for long (multi-line) comments is:
+
+    /*-
+     * This is the preferred style for multi-line
+     * comments in the OpenSSL source code.
+     * Please use it consistently.
+     *
+     * Description:  A column of asterisks on the left side,
+     * with beginning and ending almost-blank lines.
+     */
+
+Note the initial hypen to prevent indent from modifying the comment.
+Use this if the comment has particular formatting that must be preserved.
+
+It's also important to comment data, whether they are basic types or
+derived types. To this end, use just one data declaration per line (no
+commas for multiple data declarations). This leaves you room for a small
+comment on each item, explaining its use.
+

+                Chapter 11: Deleted
+
+
+                Chapter 12: Macros and Enums
+
+Names of macros defining constants and labels in enums are in uppercase:
+
+    #define CONSTANT 0x12345
+
+Enums are preferred when defining several related constants.
+
+Macro names should be in uppercase, but macros resembling functions may
+be written in lower case. Generally, inline functions are preferable to
+macros resembling functions.
+
+Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while block:
+
+    #define macrofun(a, b, c)   \
+        do {                    \
+            if (a == 5)         \
+                do_this(b, c);  \
+        } while (0)
+
+Do not write macros that affect control flow:
+
+    #define FOO(x)                 \
+        do {                       \
+            if (blah(x) &lt; 0)       \
+                return -EBUGGERED; \
+        } while(0)
+
+Do not write macros that depend on having a local variable with a magic name:
+
+    #define FOO(val) bar(index, val)
+
+It is confusing to the reader and is prone to breakage from seemingly
+innocent changes.
+
+Do not write macros that are l-values:
+
+    FOO(x) = y
+
+This will cause problems if, e.g., FOO becomes an inline function.
+
+Be careful of precedence. Macros defining constants using expressions
+must enclose the expression in parentheses:
+
+    #define CONSTANT 0x4000
+    #define CONSTEXP (CONSTANT | 3)
+
+Beware of similar issues with macros using parameters. The GNU cpp manual
+deals with macros exhaustively.
+
+
+                Chapter 13: Deleted
+
+
+                Chapter 14: Allocating memory
+
+OpenSSL provides the following general purpose memory allocators:
+OPENSSL_malloc(), OPENSSL_realloc(), OPENSSL_strdup() and OPENSSL_free().
+Please refer to the API documentation for further information about them.
+
+
+                Chapter 15: Deleted
+
+
+                Chapter 16: Function return values and names
+
+Functions can return values of many different kinds, and one of the
+most common is a value indicating whether the function succeeded or
+failed. Usually this is:
+
+    1: success
+    0: failure
+
+Sometimes an additional value is used:
+
+    -1: something bad (e.g., internal error or memory allocation failure)
+
+Other API's use the following pattern:
+
+    &gt;= 1: success, with value returning additional information
+    &lt;= 0: failure with return value indicating why things failed
+
+Somtimes a return value of -1 can mean &quot;should retry&quot; (e.g., BIO, SSL, et al).
+
+Functions whose return value is the actual result of a computation,
+rather than an indication of whether the computation succeeded, are not
+subject to these rules. Generally they indicate failure by returning some
+out-of-range result. The simplest example is functions that return pointers;
+they use NULL to report failure.
+
+
+                Chapter 17:  Deleted
+
+
+                Chapter 18:  Editor modelines
+
+Some editors can interpret configuration information embedded in source
+files, indicated with special markers. For example, emacs interprets
+lines marked like this:
+
+    -*- mode: c -*-
+
+Or like this:
+
+    /*
+    Local Variables:
+    compile-command: &quot;gcc -DMAGIC_DEBUG_FLAG foo.c&quot;
+    End:
+    */
+
+Vim interprets markers that look like this:
+
+    /* vim:set sw=8 noet */
+
+Do not include any of these in source files. People have their own personal
+editor configurations, and your source files should not override them.
+This includes markers for indentation and mode configuration. People may
+use their own custom mode, or may have some other magic method for making
+indentation work correctly.
+
+
+                Chapter 19:  Processor-specific code
+
+In OpenSSL case the only reason to resort for processor-specific code
+is for performance. As it still exists in general platform-independent
+algorithm context, it has to be always backed up by neutral pure C one. This
+implies certain limitations. The most common way to resolve this conflict
+is to opt for short inline assembly function-like snippets, customarily
+implemented as macros, so that they can be easily interchanged with other
+platform-specific or neutral code. As with any macro, try to implement
+it as single expression.
+
+You may need to mark your asm statement as volatile, to prevent GCC from
+removing it if GCC doesn't notice any side effects. You don't always need
+to do so, though, and doing so unnecessarily can limit optimization.
+
+When writing a single inline assembly statement containing multiple
+instructions, put each instruction on a separate line in a separate quoted
+string, and end each string except the last with \n\t to properly indent
+the next instruction in the assembly output:
+
+        asm (&quot;magic %reg1, #42\n\t&quot;
+             &quot;more_magic %reg2, %reg3&quot;
+             : /* outputs */ : /* inputs */ : /* clobbers */);
+
+Large, non-trivial assembly functions go in pure assembly modules, with
+corresponding C prototypes defined in C. The preferred way to implement this
+is so-called &quot;perlasm&quot;: instead of writing real .s file, you write a perl
+script that generates one. This allows use symbolic names for variables
+(register as well as locals allocated on stack) that are independent on
+specific assembler. It simplifies implementation of recurring instruction
+sequences with regular permutation of inputs. By adhering to specific
+coding rules, perlasm is also used to support multiple ABIs and assemblers,
+see crypto/perlasm/x86_64-xlate.pl for an example.
+
+Another option for processor-specific primarily SIMD capabilities is
+called compiler intrinsics. We avoid this, because it's not very much
+less complicated than coding pure assembly, and it doesn't provide same
+performance guarantee across different micro-architecture. Nor is it
+portable enough to meet our multi-platform support goals.
+
+
+                Chapter 20:  Portability
+
+To maximise portability the version of C defined in ISO/IEC 9899:1990
+should be used. This is more commonly referred to as C90. ISO/IEC 9899:1999
+(also known as C99) is not supported on some platforms that OpenSSL is
+used on and therefore should be avoided.
