    Update Windows installation instructions
    
    The windows installation instructions were very out of date. Substantial
    update to the text. Remove a lot of historical stuff that isn't relevant
    any more, and merge the win64 and win32 instructions into one file.

- INSTALLATION ON THE WIN32 PLATFORM
- ----------------------------------
-
- [Instructions for building for Windows CE can be found in INSTALL.WCE]
- [Instructions for building for Win64 can be found in INSTALL.W64]
-
- Here are a few comments about building OpenSSL for Win32 environments,
- such as Windows NT and Windows 9x. It should be noted though that
- Windows 9x are not ordinarily tested. Its mention merely means that we
- attempt to maintain certain programming discipline and pay attention
- to backward compatibility issues, in other words it's kind of expected
- to work on Windows 9x, but no regression tests are actually performed.
-
- On additional note newer OpenSSL versions are compiled and linked with
- Winsock 2. This means that minimum OS requirement was elevated to NT 4
- and Windows 98 [there is Winsock 2 update for Windows 95 though].
-
- - you need Perl for Win32.  Unless you will build on Cygwin, you will need
-   ActiveState Perl, available from <A HREF="http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl.">http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl.</A>
-
- - one of the following C compilers:
-
-  * Visual C++
-  * Borland C
-  * GNU C (Cygwin or MinGW)
-
-- Netwide Assembler, a.k.a. NASM, available from <A HREF="http://nasm.sourceforge.net/">http://nasm.sourceforge.net/</A>
-  is required if you intend to utilize assembler modules. Note that NASM
-  is now the only supported assembler.
-
- If you are compiling from a tarball or a Git snapshot then the Win32 files
- may well be not up to date. This may mean that some &quot;tweaking&quot; is required to
- get it all to work. See the trouble shooting section later on for if (when?)
- it goes wrong.
-
- Visual C++
- ----------
-
- If you want to compile in the assembly language routines with Visual
- C++, then you will need already mentioned Netwide Assembler binary,
- nasmw.exe or nasm.exe, to be available on your %PATH%.
-
- Firstly you should run Configure with platform VC-WIN32:
-
- &gt; perl Configure VC-WIN32 --prefix=c:\some\openssl\dir
-
- Where the prefix argument specifies where OpenSSL will be installed to.
-
- Next you need to build the Makefiles and optionally the assembly
- language files:
-
- - If you are using NASM then run:
-
-   &gt; ms\do_nasm
-
- - If you don't want to use the assembly language files at all then run:
-
-   &gt; perl Configure VC-WIN32 no-asm --prefix=c:/some/openssl/dir
-   &gt; ms\do_ms
-
- If you get errors about things not having numbers assigned then check the
- troubleshooting section: you probably won't be able to compile it as it
- stands.
-
- Then from the VC++ environment at a prompt do:
-
- &gt; nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak
-
- If all is well it should compile and you will have some DLLs and
- executables in out32dll. If you want to try the tests then do:
- 
- &gt; nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak test
-
-
- To install OpenSSL to the specified location do:
-
- &gt; nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak install
-
- Tweaks:
-
- There are various changes you can make to the Win32 compile
- environment. By default the library is not compiled with debugging
- symbols. If you use the platform debug-VC-WIN32 instead of VC-WIN32
- then debugging symbols will be compiled in.
-
- By default in 1.0.0 OpenSSL will compile builtin ENGINES into the
- separate shared librariesy. If you specify the &quot;enable-static-engine&quot;
- option on the command line to Configure the shared library build
- (ms\ntdll.mak) will compile the engines into libeay32.dll instead.
-
- The default Win32 environment is to leave out any Windows NT specific
- features.
-
- If you want to enable the NT specific features of OpenSSL (currently
- only the logging BIO) follow the instructions above but call the batch
- file do_nt.bat instead of do_ms.bat.
-
- You can also build a static version of the library using the Makefile
- ms\nt.mak
-
-
- Borland C++ builder 5
- ---------------------
-
- * Configure for building with Borland Builder:
-   &gt; perl Configure BC-32
-
- * Create the appropriate makefile
-   &gt; ms\do_nasm
-
- * Build
-   &gt; make -f ms\bcb.mak
-
- Borland C++ builder 3 and 4
- ---------------------------
-
- * Setup PATH. First must be GNU make then bcb4/bin 
-
- * Run ms\bcb4.bat
-
- * Run make:
-   &gt; make -f bcb.mak
-
- GNU C (Cygwin)
- --------------
-
- Cygwin implements a Posix/Unix runtime system (cygwin1.dll) on top of
- Win32 subsystem and provides a bash shell and GNU tools environment.
- Consequently, a make of OpenSSL with Cygwin is virtually identical to
- Unix procedure. It is also possible to create Win32 binaries that only
- use the Microsoft C runtime system (msvcrt.dll or crtdll.dll) using
- MinGW. MinGW can be used in the Cygwin development environment or in a
- standalone setup as described in the following section.
-
- To build OpenSSL using Cygwin:
-
- * Install Cygwin (see <A HREF="http://cygwin.com/">http://cygwin.com/</A>)
-
- * Install Perl and ensure it is in the path. Both Cygwin perl
-   (5.6.1-2 or newer) and ActivePerl work.
-
- * Run the Cygwin bash shell
-
- * $ tar zxvf openssl-x.x.x.tar.gz
-   $ cd openssl-x.x.x
-
-   To build the Cygwin version of OpenSSL:
-
-   $ ./config
-   [...]
-   $ make
-   [...]
-   $ make test
-   $ make install
-
-   This will create a default install in /usr/local/ssl.
-
-   To build the MinGW version (native Windows) in Cygwin:
-
-   $ ./Configure mingw
-   [...]
-   $ make
-   [...]
-   $ make test
-   $ make install
-
- Cygwin Notes:
-
- &quot;make test&quot; and normal file operations may fail in directories
- mounted as text (i.e. mount -t c:\somewhere /home) due to Cygwin
- stripping of carriage returns. To avoid this ensure that a binary
- mount is used, e.g. mount -b c:\somewhere /home.
-
- &quot;bc&quot; is not provided in older Cygwin distribution.  This causes a
- non-fatal error in &quot;make test&quot; but is otherwise harmless.  If
- desired and needed, GNU bc can be built with Cygwin without change.
-
- GNU C (MinGW/MSYS)
- -------------
-
- * Compiler and shell environment installation:
-
-   MinGW and MSYS are available from <A HREF="http://www.mingw.org/,">http://www.mingw.org/,</A> both are
-   required. Run the installers and do whatever magic they say it takes
-   to start MSYS bash shell with GNU tools on its PATH.
-
-   N.B. Since source tar-ball can contain symbolic links, it's essential
-   that you use accompanying MSYS tar to unpack the source. It will
-   either handle them in one way or another or fail to extract them,
-   which does the trick too. Latter means that you may safely ignore all
-   &quot;cannot create symlink&quot; messages, as they will be &quot;re-created&quot; at
-   configure stage by copying corresponding files. Alternative programs
-   were observed to create empty files instead, which results in build
-   failure.
-
- * Compile OpenSSL:
-
-   $ ./config
-   [...]
-   $ make
-   [...]
-   $ make test
-
-   This will create the library and binaries in root source directory
-   and openssl.exe application in apps directory.
-
-   It is also possible to cross-compile it on Linux by configuring
-   with './Configure --cross-compile-prefix=i386-mingw32- mingw ...'.
-   'make test' is naturally not applicable then.
-
-   libcrypto.a and libssl.a are the static libraries. To use the DLLs,
-   link with libeay32.a and libssl32.a instead.
-
-   See troubleshooting if you get error messages about functions not
-   having a number assigned.
-
- Installation
- ------------
-
- If you used the Cygwin procedure above, you have already installed and
- can skip this section.  For all other procedures, there's currently no real
- installation procedure for Win32.  There are, however, some suggestions:
-
-    - do nothing.  The include files are found in the inc32/ subdirectory,
-      all binaries are found in out32dll/ or out32/ depending if you built
-      dynamic or static libraries.
-
-    - do as is written in INSTALL.Win32 that comes with modssl:
-
-	$ md c:\openssl 
-	$ md c:\openssl\bin
-	$ md c:\openssl\lib
-	$ md c:\openssl\include
-	$ md c:\openssl\include\openssl
-	$ copy /b inc32\openssl\*       c:\openssl\include\openssl
-	$ copy /b out32dll\ssleay32.lib c:\openssl\lib
-	$ copy /b out32dll\libeay32.lib c:\openssl\lib
-	$ copy /b out32dll\ssleay32.dll c:\openssl\bin
-	$ copy /b out32dll\libeay32.dll c:\openssl\bin
-	$ copy /b out32dll\openssl.exe  c:\openssl\bin
-
-      Of course, you can choose another device than c:.  C: is used here
-      because that's usually the first (and often only) harddisk device.
-      Note: in the modssl INSTALL.Win32, p: is used rather than c:.
-
-
- Troubleshooting
- ---------------
-
- Since the Win32 build is only occasionally tested it may not always compile
- cleanly.  If you get an error about functions not having numbers assigned
- when you run ms\do_ms then this means the Win32 ordinal files are not up to
- date. You can do:
-
- &gt; perl util\mkdef.pl crypto ssl update
-
- then ms\do_XXX should not give a warning any more. However the numbers that
- get assigned by this technique may not match those that eventually get
- assigned in the Git tree: so anything linked against this version of the
- library may need to be recompiled.
-
- If you get errors about unresolved symbols there are several possible
- causes.
-
- If this happens when the DLL is being linked and you have disabled some
- ciphers then it is possible the DEF file generator hasn't removed all
- the disabled symbols: the easiest solution is to edit the DEF files manually
- to delete them. The DEF files are ms\libeay32.def ms\ssleay32.def.
-
- Another cause is if you missed or ignored the errors about missing numbers
- mentioned above.
-
- If you get warnings in the code then the compilation will halt.
-
- The default Makefile for Win32 halts whenever any warnings occur. Since VC++
- has its own ideas about warnings which don't always match up to other
- environments this can happen. The best fix is to edit the file with the
- warning in and fix it. Alternatively you can turn off the halt on warnings by
- editing the CFLAG line in the Makefile and deleting the /WX option.
-
- You might get compilation errors. Again you will have to fix these or report
- them.
-
- One final comment about compiling applications linked to the OpenSSL library.
- If you don't use the multithreaded DLL runtime library (/MD option) your
- program will almost certainly crash because malloc gets confused -- the
- OpenSSL DLLs are statically linked to one version, the application must
- not use a different one.  You might be able to work around such problems
- by adding CRYPTO_malloc_init() to your program before any calls to the
- OpenSSL libraries: This tells the OpenSSL libraries to use the same
- malloc(), free() and realloc() as the application.  However there are many
- standard library functions used by OpenSSL that call malloc() internally
- (e.g. fopen()), and OpenSSL cannot change these; so in general you cannot
- rely on CRYPTO_malloc_init() solving your problem, and you should
- consistently use the multithreaded library.
-
- Linking your application
- ------------------------
-
- If you link with static OpenSSL libraries [those built with ms/nt.mak],
- then you're expected to additionally link your application with
- WS2_32.LIB, ADVAPI32.LIB, GDI32.LIB and USER32.LIB. Those developing
- non-interactive service applications might feel concerned about linking
- with the latter two, as they are justly associated with interactive
- desktop, which is not available to service processes. The toolkit is
- designed to detect in which context it's currently executed, GUI,
- console app or service, and act accordingly, namely whether or not to
- actually make GUI calls. Additionally those who wish to
- /DELAYLOAD:GDI32.DLL and /DELAYLOAD:USER32.DLL and actually keep them
- off service process should consider implementing and exporting from
- .exe image in question own _OPENSSL_isservice not relying on USER32.DLL.
- E.g., on Windows Vista and later you could:
-
-	__declspec(dllexport) __cdecl BOOL _OPENSSL_isservice(void)
-	{   DWORD sess;
-	    if (ProcessIdToSessionId(GetCurrentProcessId(),&amp;sess))
-	        return sess==0;
-	    return FALSE;
-	}
-
- If you link with OpenSSL .DLLs, then you're expected to include into
- your application code small &quot;shim&quot; snippet, which provides glue between
- OpenSSL BIO layer and your compiler run-time. Look up OPENSSL_Applink
- reference page for further details.

- INSTALLATION ON THE WIN64 PLATFORM
- ----------------------------------
-
- Caveat lector
- -------------
-
- As of moment of this writing Win64 support is classified &quot;initial&quot;
- for the following reasons.
-
- - No assembler modules are engaged upon initial 0.9.8 release.
- - API might change within 0.9.8 life-span, *but* in a manner which
-   doesn't break backward binary compatibility. Or in other words,
-   application programs compiled with initial 0.9.8 headers will
-   be expected to work with future minor release .DLL without need
-   to re-compile, even if future minor release features modified API.
- - Above mentioned API modifications have everything to do with
-   elimination of a number of limitations, which are normally
-   considered inherent to 32-bit platforms. Which in turn is why they
-   are treated as limitations on 64-bit platform such as Win64:-)
-   The current list comprises [but not necessarily limited to]:
-
-   - null-terminated strings may not be longer than 2G-1 bytes,
-     longer strings are treated as zero-length;
-   - dynamically and *internally* allocated chunks can't be larger
-     than 2G-1 bytes;
-   - inability to encrypt/decrypt chunks of data larger than 4GB
-     [it's possibly to *hash* chunks of arbitrary size through];
-
-   Neither of these is actually big deal and hardly encountered
-   in real-life applications.
-
- Compiling procedure
- -------------------
-
- You will need Perl. You can run under Cygwin or you can download
- ActiveState Perl from <A HREF="http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl.">http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl.</A>
-
- You will need Microsoft Platform SDK, available for download at
- <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/.">http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/.</A> As per
- April 2005 Platform SDK is equipped with Win64 compilers, as well
- as assemblers, but it might change in the future.
-
- To build for Win64/x64:
-
- &gt; perl Configure VC-WIN64A
- &gt; ms\do_win64a
- &gt; nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak
- &gt; cd out32dll
- &gt; ..\ms\test

- &gt; ms\do_win64i
- &gt; nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak
- &gt; cd out32dll
- &gt; ..\ms\test

+  * GNU C (Cygwin or MinGW)
+
+- Netwide Assembler, a.k.a. NASM, available from <A HREF="http://www.nasm.us,">http://www.nasm.us,</A>
+  is required if you intend to utilize assembler modules. Note that NASM
+  is now the only supported assembler. Without this the &quot;Configure&quot; step below
+  must be done with the &quot;no-asm&quot; option. The Microsoft provided assembler is NOT
+  supported.
+
+ Visual C++
+ ----------
+
+ If you want to compile in the assembly language routines with Visual
+ C++, then you will need the Netwide Assembler binary, nasmw.exe or nasm.exe, to
+ be available on your %PATH%.
+
+ Firstly you should run Configure and generate the Makefiles. If you don't want
+ the assembly language files then add the &quot;no-asm&quot; option (without quotes) to
+ the Configure lines below.
+
+ For Win32:
+
+ &gt; perl Configure VC-WIN32 --prefix=c:\some\openssl\dir
+ &gt; ms\do_nasm
+
+ Note: replace the last line above with the following if not using the assembly
+ language files:
+
+ &gt; ms\do_ms
+
+ For Win64/x64:
+
+ &gt; perl Configure VC-WIN64A --prefix=c:\some\openssl\dir
+ &gt; ms\do_win64a
+
+ For Win64/IA64:
+
+ &gt; perl Configure VC-WIN64I --prefix=c:\some\openssl\dir
+ &gt; ms\do_win64i
+
+ Where the prefix argument specifies where OpenSSL will be installed to.
+
+ Then from the VC++ environment at a prompt do the following. Note, your %PATH%
+ and other environment variables should be set up for 32-bit or 64-bit
+ development as appropriate.
+
+ &gt; nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak
+
+ If all is well it should compile and you will have some DLLs and
+ executables in out32dll. If you want to try the tests then do:
+
+ &gt; nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak test
+
+ To install OpenSSL to the specified location do:
+
+ &gt; nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak install
+
+ Tweaks:
+
+ There are various changes you can make to the Windows compile
+ environment. By default the library is not compiled with debugging
+ symbols. If you add --debug to the Configure lines above then debugging symbols
+ will be compiled in.
+
+ By default in 1.1.0 OpenSSL will compile builtin ENGINES into separate shared
+ libraries. If you specify the &quot;enable-static-engine&quot; option on the command line
+ to Configure the shared library build (ms\ntdll.mak) will compile the engines
+ into libeay32.dll instead.
+
+ You can also build a static version of the library using the Makefile
+ ms\nt.mak
+
+ GNU C (Cygwin)

+
+ Cygwin implements a Posix/Unix runtime system (cygwin1.dll) on top of the

+ use the Microsoft C runtime system (msvcrt.dll or crtdll.dll) using
+ MinGW. MinGW can be used in the Cygwin development environment or in a
+ standalone setup as described in the following section.
+
+ To build OpenSSL using Cygwin:
+
+ * Install Cygwin (see <A HREF="http://cygwin.com/">http://cygwin.com/</A>)
+
+ * Install Perl and ensure it is in the path. Both Cygwin perl
+   (5.6.1-2 or newer) and ActivePerl work.
+
+ * Run the Cygwin bash shell
+
+ * $ tar zxvf openssl-x.x.x.tar.gz
+   $ cd openssl-x.x.x
+
+   To build the Cygwin version of OpenSSL:
+
+   $ ./config
+   [...]
+   $ make
+   [...]
+   $ make test
+   $ make install
+
+   This will create a default install in /usr/local/ssl.
+
+   To build the MinGW version (native Windows) in Cygwin:
+
+   $ ./Configure mingw
+   [...]
+   $ make
+   [...]
+   $ make test
+   $ make install
+
+ Cygwin Notes:
+
+ &quot;make test&quot; and normal file operations may fail in directories
+ mounted as text (i.e. mount -t c:\somewhere /home) due to Cygwin
+ stripping of carriage returns. To avoid this ensure that a binary
+ mount is used, e.g. mount -b c:\somewhere /home.
+
+ GNU C (MinGW/MSYS)
+ -------------
+
+ * Compiler and shell environment installation:
+
+   MinGW and MSYS are available from <A HREF="http://www.mingw.org/,">http://www.mingw.org/,</A> both are
+   required. Run the installers and do whatever magic they say it takes
+   to start MSYS bash shell with GNU tools on its PATH.
+
+ * Compile OpenSSL:
+
+   $ ./config
+   [...]
+   $ make
+   [...]
+   $ make test
+
+   This will create the library and binaries in root source directory
+   and openssl.exe application in apps directory.
+
+   It is also possible to cross-compile it on Linux by configuring
+   with './Configure --cross-compile-prefix=i386-mingw32- mingw ...'. Other
+   possible targets include x86_64-w64-mingw32- and i686-w64-mingw32-.
+
+   libcrypto.a and libssl.a are the static libraries. To use the DLLs,
+   link with libeay32.a and libssl32.a instead.
+
+ Linking your application
+ ------------------------
+
+ If you link with static OpenSSL libraries [those built with ms/nt.mak],
+ then you're expected to additionally link your application with
+ WS2_32.LIB, ADVAPI32.LIB, GDI32.LIB and USER32.LIB. Those developing
+ non-interactive service applications might feel concerned about linking
+ with the latter two, as they are justly associated with interactive
+ desktop, which is not available to service processes. The toolkit is
+ designed to detect in which context it's currently executed, GUI,
+ console app or service, and act accordingly, namely whether or not to
+ actually make GUI calls. Additionally those who wish to
+ /DELAYLOAD:GDI32.DLL and /DELAYLOAD:USER32.DLL and actually keep them
+ off service process should consider implementing and exporting from
+ .exe image in question own _OPENSSL_isservice not relying on USER32.DLL.
+ E.g., on Windows Vista and later you could:
+
+	__declspec(dllexport) __cdecl BOOL _OPENSSL_isservice(void)
+	{   DWORD sess;
+	    if (ProcessIdToSessionId(GetCurrentProcessId(),&amp;sess))
+	        return sess==0;
+	    return FALSE;
+	}
+
+ If you link with OpenSSL .DLLs, then you're expected to include into
+ your application code small &quot;shim&quot; snippet, which provides glue between
+ OpenSSL BIO layer and your compiler run-time. See the OPENSSL_Applink
+ manual page for further details.
