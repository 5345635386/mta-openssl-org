 The functions SSL_CTX_dane_enable(), SSL_CTX_dane_mtype_set(),
-SSL_dane_enable() and SSL_dane_tlsa_add() return a positive value
-on success.  Negative return values indicate resource problems (out
-of memory, etc.) in the SSL library, while a return value of B&lt;0&gt;
-indicates incorrect usage or invalid input, such as an unsupported
-TLSA record certificate usage, selector or matching type.  Invalid
-input also includes malformed data, either a digest length that
-does not match the digest algorithm, or a C&lt;Full(0)&gt; (binary ASN.1
-DER form) certificate or a public key that fails to parse.
-
-The functions SSL_get0_dane_authority() and SSL_get0_dane_tlsa()
-return a negative value when DANE authentication failed or was not
-enabled, a non-negative value indicates the chain depth at which
-the TLSA record matched a chain certificate, or the depth of the
-top-most certificate, when the TLSA record is a full public key
-that is its signer.

-be doing &quot;opportunistic DANE TLS&quot; in the sense of RFC7672 and
-RFC7435.  That is, they will use DANE authentication when
-DNSSEC-validated TLSA records are published for a given peer, and

-Such applications should generally treat any TLSA records published
-by the peer with usages PKIX-TA(0) and PKIX-EE(1) as &quot;unusable&quot;,
-and should not include them among the TLSA records used to authenticate
-peer connections.  In addition, some TLSA records with supported
