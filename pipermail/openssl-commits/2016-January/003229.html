 =head2 HASHED DIR METHOD
 
-B&lt;X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir&gt; is more sophisticated method, which loads
-certificates and CRLs on demand, but caches them in the memory once they
-are loaded. However, since OpenSSL 1.0.0beta1 it checks for newer CRLs
-upon each lookup, so if newer CRL would appear in the directory, it
-would be loaded.

-Directory should contain each certificate and CRL in the separate file

-number among certificates with same hash value, so it is possible to
-have in the store several certificates with same subject or several CRLs
-with same issuer (and, for example, different validity period).
-
-When checking for new CRLs once one CRL for given hash value is loaded, 
-hash_dir lookup method checks only for certificates with sequentual
-number greater than one of already cached CRL.

-Note that hash algorithm used for subject hashing is changed in OpenSSL

+B&lt;X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir&gt; is a more advanced method, which loads
+certificates and CRLs on demand, and caches them in memory once
+they are loaded. As of OpenSSL 1.0.0, it also checks for newer CRLs
+upon each lookup, so that newer CRLs are as soon as they appear in
+the directory.
+
+The directory should contain one certificate or CRL per file in PEM format,
+with a file name of the form I&lt;hash&gt;.I&lt;N&gt; for a certificate, or
+I&lt;hash&gt;.B&lt;r&gt;I&lt;N&gt; for a CRL.
+The I&lt;hash&gt; is the value returned by the L&lt;X509_NAME_hash(3)&gt; function applied
+to the subject name for certificates or issuer name for CRLs.
+The hash can also be obtained via the B&lt;-hash&gt; option of the L&lt;x509(1)&gt; or
+L&lt;crl(1)&gt; commands.
+
+The .I&lt;N&gt; or .B&lt;r&gt;I&lt;N&gt; suffix is a sequence number that starts at zero, and is
+incremented consecutively for each certificate or CRL with the same I&lt;hash&gt;
+value.
+Gaps in the sequence numbers are not supported, it is assumed that there are no
+more objects with the same hash beyond the first missing number in the
+sequence.
+
+Sequence numbers make it possible for the directory to contain multiple
+certificates with same subject name hash value.
+For example, it is possible to have in the store several certificates with same
+subject or several CRLs with same issuer (and, for example, different validity
+period).
+
+When checking for new CRLs once one CRL for given hash value is
+loaded, hash_dir lookup method checks only for certificates with
+sequence number greater than that of the already cached CRL.
+
+Note that the hash algorithm used for subject name hashing changed in OpenSSL
+1.0.0, and all certificate stores have to be rehashed when moving from OpenSSL
 0.9.8 to 1.0.0.
