+OpenSSL Security Advisory [28th Jan 2016]
+=========================================
+
+NOTE: SUPPORT FOR VERSION 1.0.1 WILL BE ENDING ON 31ST DECEMBER 2016. NO
+SECURITY FIXES WILL BE PROVIDED AFTER THAT DATE. UNTIL THAT TIME SECURITY FIXES
+ONLY ARE BEING APPLIED.
+
+DH small subgroups (CVE-2016-0701)
+==================================
+
+Severity: High
+
+Historically OpenSSL usually only ever generated DH parameters based on &quot;safe&quot;
+primes. More recently (in version 1.0.2) support was provided for generating
+X9.42 style parameter files such as those required for RFC 5114 support. The
+primes used in such files may not be &quot;safe&quot;. Where an application is using DH
+configured with parameters based on primes that are not &quot;safe&quot; then an attacker
+could use this fact to find a peer's private DH exponent. This attack requires
+that the attacker complete multiple handshakes in which the peer uses the same
+private DH exponent. For example this could be used to discover a TLS server's
+private DH exponent if it's reusing the private DH exponent or it's using a
+static DH ciphersuite.
+
+OpenSSL provides the option SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE for ephemeral DH (DHE) in TLS.
+It is not on by default. If the option is not set then the server reuses the
+same private DH exponent for the life of the server process and would be
+vulnerable to this attack. It is believed that many popular applications do set
+this option and would therefore not be at risk.
+
+OpenSSL before 1.0.2f will reuse the key if:
+- SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh()/SSL_set_tmp_dh() is used and SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is not
+  set.
+- SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh_callback()/SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback() is used, and both the
+  parameters and the key are set and SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is not used. This is
+  an undocumted feature and parameter files don't contain the key.
+- Static DH ciphersuites are used. The key is part of the certificate and
+  so it will always reuse it. This is only supported in 1.0.2.
+
+It will not reuse the key for DHE ciphers suites if:
+- SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is set
+- SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh_callback()/SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback() is used and the
+  callback does not provide the key, only the parameters. The callback is
+  almost always used like this.
+
+Non-safe primes are generated by OpenSSL when using:
+- genpkey with the dh_rfc5114 option. This will write an X9.42 style file
+  including the prime-order subgroup size &quot;q&quot;. This is supported since the 1.0.2
+  version. Older versions can't read files generated in this way.
+- dhparam with the -dsaparam option. This has always been documented as
+  requiring the single use.
+
+The fix for this issue adds an additional check where a &quot;q&quot; parameter is
+available (as is the case in X9.42 based parameters). This detects the
+only known attack, and is the only possible defense for static DH ciphersuites.
+This could have some performance impact.
+
+Additionally the SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE option has been switched on by default
+and cannot be disabled. This could have some performance impact.
+
+This issue affects OpenSSL version 1.0.2.
+
+OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2f
+
+OpenSSL 1.0.1 is not affected by this CVE because it does not support X9.42
+based parameters. It is possible to generate parameters using non &quot;safe&quot; primes,
+but this option has always been documented as requiring single use and is not
+the default or believed to be common. However, as a precaution, the
+SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE change has also been backported to 1.0.1r.
+
+This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 12 January 2016 by Antonio Sanso (Adobe).
+The fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team
+(incorporating some work originally written by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL
+core team).
+
+SSLv2 doesn't block disabled ciphers (CVE-2015-3197)
+====================================================
+
+Severity: Low
+
+A malicious client can negotiate SSLv2 ciphers that have been disabled on the
+server and complete SSLv2 handshakes even if all SSLv2 ciphers have been
+disabled, provided that the SSLv2 protocol was not also disabled via
+SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2.
+
+This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 and 1.0.1.
+
+OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2f
+OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1r
+
+This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 26th December 2015 by Nimrod Aviram and
+Sebastian Schinzel. The fix was developed by Nimrod Aviram with further
+development by Viktor Dukhovni of the OpenSSL development team.
+
+
+An update on DHE man-in-the-middle protection (Logjam)
+====================================================================
+
+A previously published vulnerability in the TLS protocol allows a
+man-in-the-middle attacker to downgrade vulnerable TLS connections
+using ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange to 512-bit export-grade
+cryptography. This vulnerability is known as Logjam
+(CVE-2015-4000). OpenSSL added Logjam mitigation for TLS clients by
+rejecting handshakes with DH parameters shorter than 768 bits in
+releases 1.0.2b and 1.0.1n.
+
+This limit has been increased to 1024 bits in this release, to offer
+stronger cryptographic assurance for all TLS connections using
+ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
+
+OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2f
+OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1r
+
+The fix was developed by Kurt Roeckx of the OpenSSL development team.
+
+Note
+====
+
+As per our previous announcements and our Release Strategy
+(<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/policies/releasestrat.html">https://www.openssl.org/policies/releasestrat.html</A>), support for OpenSSL
+version 1.0.1 will cease on 31st December 2016. No security updates for that
+version will be provided after that date. Users of 1.0.1 are
+advised to upgrade.
+
+Support for versions 0.9.8 and 1.0.0 ended on 31st December 2015. Those versions
+are no longer receiving security updates.
