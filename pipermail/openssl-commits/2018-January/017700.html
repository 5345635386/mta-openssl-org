-	    &lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
-
-	    &lt;p&gt;Our policy on how we internally handle security issues
-	    is based on experience and has evolved over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
-
 	    &lt;h2&gt;Reporting security issues&lt;/h2&gt;
 
 	    &lt;p&gt;
-	    We have an email address which can be used to notify
-	    us of possible security vulnerabilities.  A subset of
-	    OpenSSL team members receive this mail, and messages
-	    can be sent using PGP encryption.  Full details are at &lt;a
-	    href=&quot;/news/vulnerabilities.html&quot;&gt;<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html&lt;/a">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html&lt;/a</A>&gt;
+            If you wish to report a possible security issue in OpenSSL
+            please &lt;a href=&quot;/news/vulnerabilities.html&quot;&gt;notify us&lt;/a&gt;.  
 	    &lt;/p&gt;
 
+            &lt;h2&gt;Issue triage&lt;/h2&gt;
+            
 	    &lt;p&gt;
-	    When we are notified about an issue we engage resources
-	    within the OpenSSL team to investigate and prioritise it.
-	    We may also utilise resources from the &lt;a href=&quot;/community/thanks.html&quot;&gt;employers&lt;/a&gt; of our team
-	    members or committers, as well as others we have worked with before.
-	    &lt;/p&gt;
+            Notifications are received by a group of OpenSSL Management Committee
+            members.  We engage resources within
+	    OpenSSL to start the investigation and prioritisation.  We may work in private
+	    with individuals who are not on the OpenSSL Management Committee as
+	    well as other organisations and
+	    our &lt;a href=&quot;/community/thanks.html&quot;&gt;employers&lt;/a&gt; where we believe
+	    this can help with the issue investigation, resolution, or
+	    testing.&lt;/p&gt;
 
-	    &lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
-
-	    &lt;p&gt;
-	    Everyone would like to get advance notice of security issues
-	    in OpenSSL.  This is a complex topic and we need to set out
-	    some background with our findings:
 	    &lt;/p&gt;
-	    &lt;ul&gt;
-	      &lt;li&gt;The more people you tell in advance the higher the
-	      likelihood that a leak will occur.  We have seen this
-	      happen before, both with OpenSSL and other projects.&lt;/li&gt;
-
-	      &lt;li&gt;A huge number of products from an equally large number of
-	      organisations use OpenSSL. It's not just secure websites, you're
-	      just as likely to find OpenSSL inside your smart TV, car, or
-	      fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
-
-	      &lt;li&gt;We strongly believe that the right to advance patches/info
-	      should not be based in any way on paid membership to some forum.
-	      You can not pay us to get security patches in advance.&lt;/li&gt;
-
-	      &lt;li&gt;We can benefit from peer review of the patches and advisory.
-	      Keeping security issues private means they can't get the level
-	      of testing or scrutiny that they otherwise would.&lt;/li&gt;
 
-	      &lt;li&gt;It is not acceptable for organisations to use advance notice
-	      in marketing as a competitive advantage.  For example &quot;if you
-	      had bought our product/used our service you would have been
-	      protected a week ago&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
-
-	      &lt;li&gt;There are actually not a large number of serious
-	      vulnerabilities in OpenSSL which make it worth spending
-	      significant time keeping our own list of vendors we trust, or
-	      signing framework agreements, or dealing with changes, and
-	      policing the policy.  This is a significant amount of effort per
-	      issue that is better spent on other things.&lt;/li&gt;
-
-	      &lt;li&gt;We have previously used third parties to handle notification
-	      for us including CPNI, oCERT, or CERT/CC, but none were
-	      suitable.&lt;/li&gt;
-
-	      &lt;li&gt;It's in the best interests of the Internet as a whole to get
-	      fixes for OpenSSL security issues out quickly. OpenSSL embargoes
-	      should be measured in days and weeks, not months or years.&lt;/li&gt;
-
-	      &lt;li&gt;Many sites affected by OpenSSL issues will be running a
-	      version of OpenSSL they got from some vendor (and likely bundled
-	      with an operating system).  The most effective way for these
-	      sites to get protected is to get an updated version from that
-	      vendor.  Sites who use their own OpenSSL compilations should be
-	      able to handle a quick patch and recompile once the issue is
-	      public.&lt;/li&gt;
-	    &lt;/ul&gt;
+	    &lt;h2&gt;Issue severity&lt;/h2&gt;
 
-	    &lt;h2&gt;Internal handling of security issues&lt;/h2&gt;
-
-	    &lt;p&gt;This leads us to our policy for security issues notified
-	    to us or found by our team which are not yet public.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-	    &lt;p&gt;&quot;private&quot; means kept within the OpenSSL management 
-	    team.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-	    &lt;p&gt;We will determine the risk of each issue being addressed.

-	    &lt;p&gt;During the investigation of issues we may work with individuals
-	    and organisations who are not on the OpenSSL Management Committee.  
-	    We do this because past experience has shown that they can add value to our

 	    &lt;h2&gt;Prenotification policy&lt;/h2&gt;

 	    website to give our scheduled update release date and time and
 	    the severity of issues being fixed by the update.  No further
-	    information about the issues will be given.  This is to aid
-	    organisations that need to ensure they have staff available
-	    to handle triaging our announcement and what it means to
-	    their organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-	    &lt;p&gt;For updates that include critical or high severity issues we will
-	    also prenotify with more details and patches.  Our policy
-	    is to let the organisations that have a general purpose OS
-	    that uses OpenSSL have a few days notice in order to prepare
-	    packages for their users and feedback test results.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-	    &lt;p&gt;We use the mailing list described at &lt;a

+	    also prenotify certain organisations with more details and
+	    patches. &lt;ul&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;The organisations we prenotify include those that produce a

+            &lt;li&gt;We may
+	    withdraw notifying certain organisations from future
 	    prenotifications if they leak issues before they are public
-	    or over time do not add value (value can be added by providing
-	    feedback, corrections, test results, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
-
-	    &lt;p&gt;Finally, note that not all security issues are notified to
-	    us directly; some come from third parties such as companies
-	    that pay for vulnerabilities, some come from country CERTs.
-	    These intermediaries, or the researchers themselves, may
-	    follow a different style of notification. This is within their
-	    rights and outside of the control of the OpenSSL team.&lt;/p&gt;
+	    or over time do not add value. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
+
+	    &lt;p&gt;Note: researchers or intermediaries who
+            notify us of issues may have their own prenotification policy in addition
+            to ours.&lt;/p&gt;

+            &lt;p&gt;The policy above is guided by our security principles:&lt;/p&gt;
