+=head1 DESCRIPTION
+
+OpenSSL's build system revolves around three questions:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item What to build for?
+
+This is about choice of platform (combination of hardware, operating
+system, and toolchain).
+
+=item What to build?
+
+This is about having all the information on what needs to be built and
+from what.
+
+=item How to build it?
+
+This is about build file generation.
+
+=back
+
+This document is all about the second item, &quot;What to build?&quot;, and most
+of all, how to specify that information.
+
+For some terms used in this document, please see the L&lt;/GLOSSARY&gt; at
+the end.
+
+=head2 F&lt;build.info&gt; files
+
+F&lt;build.info&gt; files are meta data files for OpenSSL's built file
+generators, and are used to specify exactly what end product files
+(programs, libraries, modules or scripts) are to be produced, and from
+what sources.
+
+Intermediate files, such as object files, are seldom refered to at
+all.  They sometimes can be, if there's a need, but this should happen
+very rarely, and support for that sort of thing is added on as-needed
+basis.
+
+Any time a directory or file is expected in a statement value, Unix
+syntax must be used, which means that the slash C&lt;/&gt; must be used as
+the directory separator.
+
+=head2 General syntax
+
+=head3 Comments
+
+Comments are any line that start with a hash sign (C&lt;#&gt;).  The hash
+sign may be preceded by any number of horizontal spaces.
+
+=head3 Filenames
+
+F&lt;build.info&gt; files are platform agnostic.  This means that there is
+some information in them that is representative rather than specific.
+
+This is particularly visible with end product names, they work more
+like a tag than as the actual filename that's going to be produced.
+This is because different platforms have different decorations on
+different types of files.
+
+For example, if we say that we want to produce a program C&lt;foo&gt;, it
+would look like this:
+
+    PROGRAM=foo
+
+However, the program filename may end up being just C&lt;foo&gt; (typical
+for Unix), or C&lt;foo.exe&gt; (typical for Windows), or even C&lt;BLAH$FOO.EXE&gt;
+(possible on VMS, depending on policy).
+
+These platform specific decorations are not the concern of
+F&lt;build.info&gt; files.  The build file generators are responsible for
+transforming these platform agnostic names to their platform specific
+counterparts.
+
+=head3 Statements
+
+With the exception of variables and conditions, the general statement
+syntax is one of:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item B&lt;I&lt;KEYWORD&gt;&gt; B&lt;=&gt; I&lt;value&gt; ...
+
+=item B&lt;I&lt;KEYWORD&gt;[&gt;I&lt;item&gt;B&lt;]&gt; B&lt;=&gt; I&lt;value&gt; ...
+
+=back
+
+Every B&lt;I&lt;KEYWORD&gt;&gt; represents some particular type of information.
+
+The first form (sometimes called &quot;plain statement&quot;) is used to specify
+information on what end products need to be built, for example:
+
+    PROGRAMS=foo bar
+    LIBS=libpoly libcookie
+    MODULES=awesome-plugin
+    SCRIPTS=tool1 tool2
+    SUBDIRS=dir1 dir2
+
+This says that we want to build programs C&lt;foo&gt; and C&lt;bar&gt;, the
+libraries C&lt;libpoly&gt; and C&lt;libcookie&gt;, an awesome plugin module
+C&lt;awesome-plugin&gt;, a couple of scripts C&lt;tool1&gt; and C&lt;tool2&gt;, and
+finally that there are more F&lt;build.info&gt; files in subdirectories
+C&lt;dir1&gt; and C&lt;dir2&gt;.
+
+The second form (sometimes called &quot;indexed statement&quot;) is used to
+specify further details for existing items, for example:
+
+    SOURCE[foo]=foo.c details.c
+    DEPEND[foo]=libcookie
+
+This says that the program C&lt;foo&gt; is built from the source files
+F&lt;foo.c&gt; and F&lt;details.c&gt;, and that it depends on the library
+C&lt;libcookie&gt; (in other words, the library will be included when
+linking that program together).
+
+For any indexed statement for which the item hasn't been specified
+through any plain statement, or where the item exists but the indexed
+statement does not apply, the value is simply ignored by the build
+file generators.
+
+=head3 Statement attributes
+
+Some statements can have attributes added to them, to allow for
+variations on how they are treated.
+
+=over 4
+
+=item B&lt;I&lt;KEYWORD&gt;{&gt; I&lt;attrib&gt; | I&lt;attrib&gt;B&lt;=&gt;I&lt;attrib-value&gt;  [,...]B&lt;}&gt;
+B&lt;=&gt; I&lt;value&gt; ...
+
+=back
+
+Attributes are passed as they are to the build file generators, and
+the exact interpretation of those attributes is entirely up to them
+(see L&lt;/Known attributes&gt; below for details).
+
+A current example:
+
+    LIBS{noinst,has_main}=libtestutil.a
+
+This says that the static library C&lt;libtestutil.a&gt; should not be
+installed (C&lt;noinst&gt;), and that it includes an object file that has
+the C&lt;main&gt; symbol (C&lt;has_main&gt;).  Most platforms don't need to know
+the latter, but there are some where the program linker will not look
+for C&lt;main&gt; in libraries unless it's explicitly told so, so this is
+way to tell the build file generator to emit the necessary command
+options to make that happen.
+
+Attributes are accumulated globally.  This means that a library could
+be given like this in different places:
+
+    # Location 1
+    LIBS=libwhatever
+
+    # Location 2
+    LIBS{noinst}=libwhatever
+
+    # Location 3
+    LIBS{has_main}=libwhatever
+
+The end result is that the library C&lt;libwhatever&gt; will have the
+attributes C&lt;noinst&gt; and C&lt;has_main&gt; attached to it.
+
+=head3 Quoting and tokens
+
+Statement values are normally split into a list of tokens, separated
+by spaces.
+
+To avoid having a value split up into several tokens, they may be
+quoted with double (C&lt;&quot;&gt;) or single (C&lt;'&gt;) quotes.
+
+For example:
+
+    PROGRAMS=foo &quot;space cadet&quot; bar
+
+This says that we sant to build three programs, C&lt;foo&gt;, C&lt;space cadet&gt;
+and C&lt;bar&gt;.
+
+=head3 Conditionals
+
+F&lt;build.info&gt; files include a very simple condition system, involving
+the following keywords:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item B&lt;IF[&gt;0|1B&lt;]&gt;
+
+=item B&lt;ELSIF[&gt;0|1B&lt;]&gt;
+
+=item B&lt;ELSE&gt;
+
+=item B&lt;ENDIF&gt;
+
+=back
+
+This works like any condition system with similar syntax, and the
+condition value in B&lt;IF&gt; and B&lt;ELSIF&gt; can really be any literal value
+that perl can interpret as true or false.
+
+Conditional statements are nesting.
+
+In itself, this is not very powerful, but together with L&lt;/Perl nuggets&gt;,
+it can be.
+
+=head3 Variables
+
+F&lt;build.info&gt; handles simple variables.  They are defined by
+assignment:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item B&lt;$&gt;I&lt;NAME&gt; B&lt;=&gt; I&lt;value&gt;
+
+=back
+
+These variables can then be used as part of any statement value or
+indexed statement item.  This should be used with some care, as
+I&lt;variables are expanded into their values before the value they are
+part of is tokenized&gt;.
+
+I&lt;Variable assignment values are not tokenized.&gt;
+
+=head2 Scope
+
+Most of the statement values are accumulated globally from all the
+F&lt;build.info&gt; files that are digested.  There are two exceptions,
+F&lt;build.info&gt; variables and B&lt;SUBDIRS&gt; statement, for which the scope
+is the F&lt;build.info&gt; file they are in.
+
+=head2 Perl nuggets
+
+Whenever a F&lt;build.info&gt; file is read, it is passed through the Perl
+template processor L&lt;OpenSSL::Template&gt;, which is a small extension of
+L&lt;Text::Template&gt;.
+
+Perl nuggets are anything between C&lt;{-&gt; and C&lt;-}&gt;, and whatever the
+result from such a nugget is, that value will replace the nugget in
+text form.  This is useful to get dynamically generated F&lt;build.info&gt;
+statements, and is most often seen used together with the B&lt;IF&gt; and
+B&lt;ELSIF&gt; conditional statements.
+
+For example:
+
+    IF[{- $disabled{something} -}]
+      # do whatever's needed when &quot;something&quot; is disabled
+    ELSIF[{- $somethingelse eq 'blah' -}]
+      # do whatever's needed to satisfy this condition
+    ELSE
+      # fallback
+    ENDIF
+
+Normal Perl scope applies, so it's possible to have an initial perl
+nugget that sets diverse global variables that are used in later
+nuggets.  Each nugget is a Perl block of its own, so B&lt;my&gt; definitions
+are only in scope within the same nugget, while B&lt;our&gt; definitions are
+in scope within the whole F&lt;build.info&gt; file.
+
+=head1 REFERENCE
+
+=head2 Conditionals
+
+=over 4
+
+=item B&lt;IF[&gt;0|1B&lt;]&gt;
+
+If the condition is true (represented as C&lt;1&gt; here), everything
+between this B&lt;IF&gt; and the next corresponding B&lt;ELSIF&gt; or B&lt;ELSE&gt;
+applies, and the rest until the corresponding B&lt;ENDIF&gt; is skipped
+over.
+
+If the condition is false (represented as C&lt;0&gt; here), everything
+from this B&lt;IF&gt; is skipped over until the next corresponding B&lt;ELSIF&gt;
+or B&lt;ELSE&gt;, at which point processing continues.
+
+=item B&lt;ELSE&gt;
+
+If F&lt;build.info&gt; statements have been skipped over to this point since
+the corresponding B&lt;IF&gt; or B&lt;ELSIF&gt;, F&lt;build.info&gt; processing starts
+again following this line.
+
+=item B&lt;ELSIF[&gt;0|1B&lt;]&gt;
+
+This is B&lt;ELSE&gt; and B&lt;IF&gt; combined.
+
+=item B&lt;ENDIF&gt;
+
+Marks the end of a conditional.
+
+=back
+
+=head2 Plain statements
+
+=over 4
+
+=item B&lt;SUBDIRS=&gt; I&lt;dir&gt; ...
+
+This instructs the F&lt;build.info&gt; reader to also read the F&lt;build.info&gt;
+file in every specified directory.  All directories should be given
+relative to the location of the current F&lt;build.info&gt; file.
+
+=item B&lt;PROGRAMS=&gt; I&lt;name&gt; ...
+
+Collects names of programs that should be built.
+
+B&lt;PROGRAMS&gt; statements may have attributes, which apply to all the
+programs given in such a statement.  For example:
+
+    PROGRAMS=foo
+    PROGRAMS{noinst}=bar
+
+With those two lines, the program C&lt;foo&gt; will not have the attribute
+C&lt;noinst&gt;, while the program C&lt;bar&gt; will.
+
+=item B&lt;LIBS=&gt; I&lt;name&gt; ...
+
+Collects names of libraries that should be built.
+
+The normal case is that libraries are built in both static and shared
+form.  However, if a name ends with C&lt;.a&gt;, only the static form will
+be produced.
+
+Similarly, libraries may be referred in indexed statements as just the
+plain name, or the name including the ending C&lt;.a&gt;.  If given without
+the ending C&lt;.a&gt;, any form available will be used, but if given with
+the ending C&lt;.a&gt;, the static library form is used unconditionally.
+
+B&lt;LIBS&gt; statements may have attributes, which apply to all the
+libraries given in such a statement.  For example:
+
+    LIBS=libfoo
+    LIBS{noinst}=libbar
+
+With those two lines, the library C&lt;libfoo&gt; will not have the
+attribute C&lt;noinst&gt;, while the library C&lt;libbar&gt; will.
+
+=item B&lt;MODULES=&gt; I&lt;name&gt;
+
+Collects names of dynamically loadable modules that should be built.
+
+B&lt;MODULES&gt; statements may have attributes, which apply to all the
+modules given in such a statement.  For example:
+
+    MODULES=foo
+    MODULES{noinst}=bar
+
+With those two lines, the module C&lt;foo&gt; will not have the attribute
+C&lt;noinst&gt;, while the module C&lt;bar&gt; will.
+
+=item B&lt;SCRIPTS=&gt; I&lt;name&gt;
+
+Collects names of scripts that should be built, or that just exist.
+That is how they differ from programs, as programs are always expected
+to be compiled from multiple sources.
+
+B&lt;SCRIPTS&gt; statements may have attributes, which apply to all the
+scripts given in such a statement.  For example:
+
+    SCRIPTS=foo
+    SCRIPTS{noinst}=bar
+
+With those two lines, the script C&lt;foo&gt; will not have the attribute
+C&lt;noinst&gt;, while the script C&lt;bar&gt; will.
+
+=back
+
+=head2 Indexed statements
+
+=over 4
+
+=item B&lt;DEPEND[&gt;I&lt;item&gt;B&lt;]&gt; B&lt;=&gt; I&lt;file&gt; ...
+
+Collects dependencies, where I&lt;item&gt; depends on the given I&lt;file&gt;s.
+
+As a special case, the I&lt;item&gt; may be empty, for which the build file
+generators should make the whole build depend on the given I&lt;file&gt;s,
+rather than some specific I&lt;item&gt;.
+
+The I&lt;item&gt; may be any program, library, module, script, or any
+filename used as a value anywhere.
+
+=item B&lt;GENERATE[&gt;I&lt;item&gt;B&lt;]&gt; B&lt;=&gt; I&lt;generator&gt; I&lt;generator-arg&gt; ...
+
+This specifies that the I&lt;item&gt; is generated using the I&lt;generator&gt;
+with the I&lt;generator-arg&gt;s as arguments, plus the name of the output
+file as last argument.
+
+For I&lt;generator&gt;s where this is applicable, any B&lt;INCLUDE&gt; statement
+for the same I&lt;item&gt; will be given to the I&lt;generator&gt; as its
+inclusion directories.
+
+The build file generators must be able to recognise the I&lt;generator&gt;.
+Currently, they at least recognise files ending in C&lt;.pl&gt;, and will
+execute them to generate the I&lt;item&gt;, and files ending in C&lt;.in&gt;,
+which will be used as input for L&lt;OpenSSL::Template&gt; to generate
+I&lt;item&gt; (in other words, we use the exact same style of
+L&lt;/Perl nuggets&gt; mechanism that is used to read F&lt;build.info&gt; files).
+
+=item B&lt;SOURCE[&gt;I&lt;item&gt;B&lt;]&gt; B&lt;=&gt; I&lt;file&gt; ...
+
+Collects filenames that will be used as source files for I&lt;item&gt;.
+
+The I&lt;item&gt; must be a singular item, and may be any program, library,
+module or script given with B&lt;PROGRAMS&gt;, B&lt;LIBS&gt;, B&lt;MODULES&gt; and
+B&lt;SCRIPTS&gt;.
+
+=item B&lt;SHARED_SOURCE[&gt;I&lt;item&gt;B&lt;]&gt; B&lt;=&gt; I&lt;file&gt; ...
+
+Collects filenames that will be used as source files for I&lt;item&gt;.
+
+The I&lt;item&gt; must be a singular item, and may be any library or module
+given with B&lt;LIBS&gt; or B&lt;MODULES&gt;.  For libraries, the given filenames
+are only used for their shared form, so if the item is a library name
+ending with C&lt;.a&gt;, the filenames will be ignored.
+
+=item B&lt;DEFINE[&gt;I&lt;item&gt;B&lt;]&gt; B&lt;=&gt; I&lt;name&gt;[B&lt;=&gt;I&lt;value&gt;] ...
+
+Collects I&lt;name&gt; / I&lt;value&gt; pairs (or just I&lt;name&gt; with no defined
+value if no I&lt;value&gt; is given) associated with I&lt;item&gt;.
+
+The build file generators will decide what to do with them.  For
+example, these pairs should become C macro definitions whenever a
+C&lt;.c&gt; file is built into an object file.
+
+=item B&lt;INCLUDE[&gt;I&lt;item&gt;B&lt;]&gt; B&lt;=&gt; I&lt;dir&gt; ...
+
+Collects inclusion directories that will be used when building the
+I&lt;item&gt; components (object files and whatever else).  This is used at
+the discretion of the build file generators.
+
+=back
+
+=head2 Known attributes
+
+Note: this will never be a complete list of attributes.
+
+=over 4
+
+=item B&lt;noinst&gt;
+
+This is used to specify that the end products this is set for should
+not be installed, that they are only internal.  This is applicable on
+internal static libraries, or on test programs.
+
+=item B&lt;misc&gt;
+
+This is used with B&lt;SCRIPTS&gt;, to specify that some scripts should be
+installed in the &quot;misc&quot; directory rather than the normal program
+directory.
+
+=item B&lt;engine&gt;
+
+This is used with B&lt;MODULES&gt;, to specify what modules are engines and
+should be installed in the engines directory instead of the modules
+directory.
+
+=back
+
+=head1 GLOSSARY
+
+=over 4
+
+=item &quot;build file&quot;
+
+This is any platform specific file that describes the complete build,
+with platform specific commands.  On Unix, this is typically
+F&lt;Makefile&gt;; on VMS, this is typically F&lt;descrip.mms&gt;.
+
+=item &quot;build file generator&quot;
+
+Perl code that generates build files, given configuration data and
+data collected from F&lt;build.info&gt; files.
+
+=item &quot;plain statement&quot;
+
+Any F&lt;build.info&gt; statement of the form B&lt;I&lt;KEYWORD&gt;&gt;=I&lt;values&gt;, with

+
+=item &quot;indexed statement&quot;
+
+Any F&lt;build.info&gt; statement of the form B&lt;I&lt;KEYWORD&gt;[&gt;I&lt;item&gt;B&lt;]=&gt;I&lt;values&gt;,
+with the exception of conditional statements.
+
+=item &quot;intermediate file&quot;
+
+Any file that's an intermediate between a source file and an end
+product.
+
+=item &quot;end product&quot;
+
