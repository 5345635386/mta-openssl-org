Pre reformat of master

Reviewed-by: Richard Levitte &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">levitte at openssl.org</A>&gt;

Adam Langley (20):
      Fix for EXP-RC2-CBC-MD5
      Add volatile qualifications to two blocks of inline asm to stop GCC from     eliminating them as dead code.
      Ensure that x**0 mod 1 = 0.
      Ensure that, when generating small primes, the result is actually of the     requested size. Fixes OpenSSL #2701.
      This change alters the processing of invalid, RSA pre-master secrets so     that bad encryptions are treated like random session keys in constant     time.
      Don't SEGFAULT when trying to export a public DSA key as a private key.
      Limit the number of empty records that will be processed consecutively     in order to prevent ssl3_get_record from never returning.
      Add secure DSA nonce flag.
      Make `safe' (EC)DSA nonces the default.
      Support ALPN.
      Add tests for ALPN functionality.
      Avoid double free when processing DTLS packets.
      Fix memory leak from zero-length DTLS fragments.
      Fix return code for truncated DTLS fragment.
      Remove some duplicate DTLS code.
      RT3065: ec_private_key_dont_crash
      psk_client_callback, 128-byte id bug.
      Don't set client_version to the ServerHello version.
      Premaster secret handling fixes
      Ensure that the session ID context of an SSL* is updated     when its SSL_CTX is updated.

Alok Menghrajani (3):
      Fixes a minor typo in the EVP docs.
      Improves the proxy certificates howto doc.

Alon Bar-Lev (1):
      RT1771: Add string.h include.

Andreas Westfeld (1):
      Fix typo in ideatest.c

Andr&#195;&#169; Guerreiro (1):
      Add documentation on -timeout option in the ocsp utility

Andy Polyakov (1908):
      crypto/bn/asm/mips3.s is obsolete. I'm moving it to crypto/bn/asm/obsolete     in order to replace it with a new version.
      crypto/bn/asm/mips3.s is moved to crypto/bn/asm/obsolete/
      MIPS III/IV assembler module is reimplemented.
      Get rid of redundant multiplications in bn_div_words.
      - performance retunes, v8plus bn_*_comba routines are reimplemented;     - support for GNU assembler (read SPARC Linux);
      GNU assembler (read SPARC Linux) support added.
      Added support for SPARC Linux.
      Minor MD5 tune-up for WIN32 on Intel.
      SGI IRIX config updates.
      SPARC Solaris config updates.
      when invoking bn_*_comba[48] result-&gt;top wasn't always set correctly.
      Bignum division tune-up. Idea is to move multiplications in front of     loop body and replace 'em with addition/subtraction.
      Extra i386+gcc bn_div.c tune-up featuring inline division and saving     the remainder left in %edx. Here is the resulting performance improvement     matrix (improvement as a result of this *and* previous tune-up committed     two days ago). The results were obtained by profiling the &quot;div&quot; part of     the crypto/bn/bnspeed.c.
      Minor MIPS III/IV tune-up.
      md32_common.h update and accompanying MD5 update.
      RIPEMD160 shape-up. Major news are that it's operational on all platforms     now and I'm putting it back to 'make test' later today.
      RIPEMD160 shape-up Intel assembler companion. Cycle counter benchmarks     went down from 1050 to 921 cycles on Pentium II. I haven't checked the     figures on Pentium yet.
      RIPEMD160 shape-up. Final touch.
      SHA clean-up and (LP64) tune-up.
      SHA clean-up Intel assembler companion.
      Initial support for MacOS.
      RC4 tune-up.
      RC4 tune-up featuring 30-40% performance improvement on most RISC     platforms. See crypto/rc4/rc4_enc.c for further details.
      RC4 tune-up featuring 30-40% performance improvement on most RISC     platforms. See crypto/rc4/rc4_enc.c for further details.
      MacOS updates.
      Initial support for MacOS is now available
      Late break-in patch for MacOS support.
      Even more late break-in MacOS tidbits...
      Even more late break-in MacOS tidbits (last for today)...
      Minor documentation update.
      Makefile clean-ups, crypto/bn/asm/alpha.s compiles on Alpha Linux.
      MacOS updates. Initial support for GUSI (MacOS socket implementation)     is added.
      Enhanced support for Alpha Linux. See CHANGES for details.
      Alpha Linux update companion.
      Metrowerks for Motorola tune-up.
      Rhapsody 5.5 (a.k.a. MacOS X) compiler bug workaround. At the very least     passes 'make test' now:-)
      Further work on MacOS port. See INSTALL.MacOS for details.
      Support for &quot;multiply high&quot; instruction, see BN_UMULT_HIGH comment in     crypto/bn/bn_lcl.h for further details. It should be noted that for     the moment of this writing the code was tested only on Alpha. If     compiled with DEC C the C implementation exhibits 12% performance     improvement over the crypto/bn/asm/alpha.s (on EV56 box running     AlphaLinux). GNU C is (unfortunately) 8% behind the assembler     implementation. But it's OpenVMS Alpha users who *may* benefit most     as 'apps/openssl speed rsa' exhibits 6 (six) times performance     improvement over the original VMS bignum implementation. Where &quot;*may*&quot;     means &quot;as soon as code is enabled though #define SIXTY_FOUR_BIT and     crypto/bn/asm/vms.mar is skipped.&quot;
      New xcbc_ok test vector is required after the parity bits in cbc2_key     were fixed up. The catch is that in the DESX test the cbc2_key is used     as whitening key where *all* 64 bits are significant.
      Support for MacOS X (Rhapsody) is added. Also get rid of volatile     qualifier in asm definitions as it prevents compiler from moving     the instruction(s) during optimization pass.
      HP-UX tune-up: new unified configs, HP C compiler bug workaround.
      test_mont was exercising 100-bit multiplication modulus X*I-bit, where     X is 5120 on 32-bit and 151552 on 64-bit architectures and I varies     from 0 to 4. As result the test was *unreasonably* slow and virtually     impossible to complete on 64-bit architectures (e.g. IRIX bc couldn't     even swallow such long lines).
      New NO_INLINE_ASM macro. Primary target for the moment is Solaris x86     which can't stand GNU C assembler templates.
      Avoid GNU C assembler templates under Solaris x86.
      Move CAST_S_tables to read-only segment.
      Move initial key to read-only segment.
      Move primes to read-only segment.
      There're two (incompatible) ways to write multi-threaded programs under     IRIX, one is to call sproc(2) when every thread does get own pid and     POSIX threads when all the threads share same pid.
      Linux is almost the only one where getpid() == thread-id. IRIX is     another one, but only if you stick to sproc(2).
      BN_div_recp fix. I've ran divtest for 10 mins and it didn't exhibit a     single fault:-) Needless to mention that bnbug.c posted couple of days     ago passes as well...
      Statement that it fails only on 32-bit architectures isn't true.
      MacOS tidbits. Add new files to the project, update config.
      IRIX6* tests passed.
      More tests passed.
      MacOS pseudo-random entropy collector.
      GCC 2.95.2 from IRIX 6.5 -mabi=64 compiler bug workaround:-(
      MT-support for IRIX 6.x and Alpha-Linux
      Compaq C warns that &quot;the expression 'p=scan_esc(p)' modifies the variable     'p' more than once without an intervening sequence point.  This behavior     is undefined.&quot; What it essentially complains about is 'p=p+=1'. Now it's     changed to 'p=p+1'...
      The IRIX fix. Asm recap and corresponding declation.
      Assembler support for IA-64. See the source code commentary for further     details (performance numbers and accompanying discussions:-). Note that     the code is not engaged in ./Configure yet. I'll add it later this week     along with updates for .spec file.
      Get rid of RAW dependency warnings.
      Get rid of &quot;possible WAW dependency&quot; warnings.
      This fixes &quot;Spurious test failures on IRIX?&quot; reported in April. Apparently     I was wrong in conclusions about when addition starts overflowing in combaX     routines.
      Missing line 0.9.6b release and IA-64 patch advertisement:-)
      Support for 64-bit Solaris build with GCC 3.0 and later. It should be     explicitely noted that 64-bit SPARCv9 ABI is not officially supported     by GCC 3.0 (support is scheduled for 3.1 release), but it appears to     work, at the very least 'make test' passes...
      Typo in stty command lines.
      Support for Intel and HP-UXi assemblers.
      Enhanced support for IA-64 Linux and HP-UX (as well as better support for     HP-UX in common in ./config). Note that for the moment of this writing     none of 64-bit platforms pass bntest. I'm committing this anyway as it's     too frustrating to patch snapshots over and over while 0.9.6 is known to     work.
      Just a &quot;get to know your system&quot; bit.
      linux64-sparcv9 support finally debugged and tested.
      Workaround for GCC-ia64 compiler bug.
      BN_sqr test failure entry.
      IA-32 assembler modules (primarily DES) PIC-ification. Idea is to keep     shared libraries shared.
      DES PIC-ification. Windows companion.
      x86_64 performance patch.
      New DETECT_GNU_LD procedure.
      Solaris shared build fix-ups. See RT#238,239 for details.
      As you might have noticed I tried to change for . prefix, because it's     the one to be used to denote local labels in single function scope.     Problem is that SHA uses same label set across functions, therefore I     have to switch back to $ prefix.
      Ooops! No ROTATE on some platforms after x86_64 performance patch...
      DES PIC-ification. &quot;Cygwin&quot; companion. Problem was that preprocessor macro     is not expanded if prepended with a $-sign.
      Always forget this one...
      'a=b c=$a; echo $c' doesn't necessarily prints &quot;b&quot;, '' vs. &quot;&quot;, $s in     Makefiles... I suppose it wasn't tested very much...
      Make &quot;perl des-586.pl a.out&quot; work, see RT#402
      Fix for RT#405, Solaris refuses to invoke preprocessor if egrep returns 1.     Linux for example doesn't exhibit this behaviour, but I add &quot;exit 0&quot; to all     potentially affected rules, just to be on the safe side.
      Better wording?
      Fix for &quot;shift count too large&quot; when compiling for hpux-parisc2 and     irix-mips. The bug was introduced with accelerated support for x86_64.     My fault! Fixed now.
      FAQ addenum as discussed in RT#417.
      UltraSPARC performance &quot;tune-up.&quot;
      I can't confirm the claim being removed and nobody seems to speak up for it.
      It probably belongs in PROBLEMS, but it's more likely to be a FAQ.
      My English is definitely not good as my assembly skills:-) And it looks like     titles can't be multi-line...
      I implemented this when troubleshooting performance problem on SPARC Solaris.     As there is an apparent interest for optimization for footprint, I figured     that this can eventually become useful.
      Very old submission (from 2000) of UltraSPARC assembler DES implementation.     It was not accepted because code is not PIC, too UltraSPARC-specific when     it doesn't have to and 32-bit only. I'm committing the original version     mostly for reference purposes. 64, PIC, blended CPU tune-up follows shortly.     Obtained from: <A HREF="http://inet.uni2.dk/~svolaf/des.htm">http://inet.uni2.dk/~svolaf/des.htm</A>
      UltraSPARC assembler DES implementation tune-up. The code can be     compiled for any SPARC CPU (UltraSPARC performance is *not* affected),     can be compiled for 64-bit ABI and is position-independent.
      Complete integration of SPARC assembler DES implementation. Tested on Solaris     only. I'll keep my eyes open for Linux and OpenBSD targets.
      Support for Intel compiler. More details will be provided in closing note     for RT#17 as snapshot becomes available for download.
      HP/UX 11i make gets upset by this line containing nothing but a Tab
      pa-risc2.s was not PIC, see RT#426. I strip call to fprintf as it's     never called anyway (it's a debugging assertion). If pa-risc2W.s is     PIC remains to be seen...
      Support for ILP32 on HPUX-IA64.
      Unified targets for ELF assembler modules. Tested on Linux, Solaris and     FreeBSD. Goal is to extend support even to SCO5, UnixWare/OpenUnix...
      Redundant now as it's moved to ./Makefile.org.
      Oops! I've toasted Cygwin! Fixed now.
      GAS can't stand stub, which is stb's synonym.
      Another GAS fix-up and some commentary...
      Fix a typo.
      Finalizing asm support for UnixWare, SCO, OpenUnix... Note that I've     replaced #if logic around bn_sub_part_words in bn_mul.c. I rely upon     OPENSSL_BN_ASM_PART_WORDS being added by ./Configure script. Would it     still work on non-Unix platforms?
      At least OpenBSD implements PIC in the same way ELF does.
      Avoid unnecessary pollution of object module name table. Cygwin shared     build workaround (DJGPP swallows it too). One probably should do same     as with ELF calling it COFF, but I'm very short in COFF platforms, so     I just go for easy ad-hoc solution. I'll take care of merge to 0.9.7     later.
      Just an extra comment.
      OpenBSD FAQ update. Apparently gas from binutils-2.x makes it impossible to     use gcc -fPIC ... on OpenBSD-i386. Alternative solution is provided.
      Minor FAQ update
      Fix for AIX shared build, see RT#463.
      Caldera/SCO targets erroneously limit themselves to 386. See RT#464.
      -lresolv is not present on SCO Unix, RT#460.
      SCO target missed .so suffix.
      Oops! Missed closing quote... Didn't have time to verify before a snapshot     was cut...
      This is an *initial* tune-up. This update puts Itanium2 back on par with     Itanium. I mean if overall performance improvement over C version was X     for Itanium, it's X even for Itanium2.
      Suggestion was to change ${MACHINE} to i586 in lines in question. Well,     &quot;whatever&quot; doesn't the same (avoids 386 being passed to ./Configure),     consistent with other elder SCO targets and denotes that we probably     shouldn't care much about every out-of-date platform.
      The patch speaks for itself.
      Workaround for lame compiler bug introduced in &quot;CPU pack&quot; for MSVC6SP5.
      Provide &quot;dummy&quot; &amp;main::picmeup even in Windows perlasm modules.
      ./config failed to correctly detect if gcc uses 64-bit ABI on HP-UX.     PR: 772
      hpux64-parisc2-gcc target added. Once it is verified, ./config should     be modified to choose it instead of hpux64-parisc-gcc, which should     then be removed. hpux64-parisc-cc is removed already now as redundant     [in case you wonder, 64-bit HP-UX ABI *implies* PA-RISC2.0].
      SHA-1 assembler tune-up for Intel P4
      Get rid of bogus warning when compiling with Sun vendor compiler.
      Fix declaration inconsistency in ecparam.c.
      Even though C specification explicitly says that constant type &quot;stretches&quot;     automatically to accomodate the value, some compilers fail to do so. Most     notably 0x0123456789ABCDEF should come out as long long in 32-bit context,     but HP compiler truncates it to 32-bit value. Which in turn breaks GF(2^m)     arithmetics in hpux-parisc2-cc build. Therefore this fix...
      CFB DES sync-up with FIPS branch.
      #undef _POSIX_C_SOURCE in ui_openssl.c ruined IRIX builds. Comment on why     _POSIX_C_SOURCE needed in first place.
      HP/UX PA-RISC 2 targets update.
      Typo in PA-RISC 2 rules in crypto/bn/Makefile.ssl
      Typo in crypto/bn/asm/x86_64.c, bn_div_words().     PR: 821
      IRIX 6.x shared build fix-up.
      This is essentially Intel 32-bit compiler tune-up. To start with all     available compiler versions generated bogus machine code trying to     compile new crypto/des/cfb_enc.c. Secondly, 8th version defines     __GNUC__ macro, but fails to compile *some* inline assembler correctly.     Note that all versions of icc implement MSC-like _lrot[rl] intrinsic,     which is used now instead of offensive asm. Finally, unnecessary linker     dependencies are eliminated. Most notably dependency from libirc.a     caused trouble at application start-up, if libcrypto.so is linked with     -Bsymbolic (which it is).
      Improved PowerPC support. Proper ./config support for ppc targets,     especially for AIX. But most important BIGNUM assembler implementation     submitted by IBM.
      Oops! Typo in ./config...
      Support for IA-32 SSE2 instruction set.
      SSE2 accelerated bn_mul_add_words. Code is currently disabled till proper     config and run-time support is added.     PR: 788     Submitted by: &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">dean at arctic.org</A>&gt;     Reviewed by: &lt;appro&gt;
      SSE2 SHA512_Transform implementation. No, it's not used anywhere yet and     is subject to change as C implementation is added...
      SHA-224/-256/-384/-512 implementation. This is just sheer code commit.     Makefile modifications, make test, etc. will appear later...
      CHANGES to mention improved PowerPC platform support.
      size_t-fication of message digest APIs. We should size_t-fy more APIs...
      Make reservations for FIPS code in HEAD branch, so that the moment FIPS     comes in we have required macros in place.
      Final API adaptation. Final, &quot;all openssl&quot; performance numbers [not mixture     of different implementations]. Real-life performance improvement is rated     at 2-3x, not 6x as preliminary announced.
      Stress collector/padding function.
      SHA-256/-512 update. A bug fix, SHA-512 tune-up for AMD64, hook for SSE2     code, Makefile update.
      While size_t-fying let's not forget to update documentation:-)
      SHA-256/-512 test and benchmark.
      Framework for glueing BIO layer and Win32 compiler run-time. Goal is to     make it possible to produce for a unified binary build, which can be     used with a variety of Win32 compilers.
      Documentation note for Win32 glue between BIO layer and compiler run-time.
      SHA-224 test vectors added.
      Attempt to unify hpux-shared rules. More adjustments might be required     after more tests...
      Eliminate compiler warnings and throw in performance table.
      Make sure we return 0 if test passed.
      Unified hpux-shared rule. Verified with both 32- and 64-bit builds and     both vendor and GNU compilers. ./engine shared build are still busted.     I mean always were...
      hpux-shared rules to cover even for GNU ld.
      gcc -Wcast-qual clean-up.
      Typo in linux-ppc64 target.
      Kill unused macro and reimplement it for that single context it can     actually be used, namely x86* platforms [because they don't bomb on     unaligned access]. This resulted in 30-40% [depending on message     length] improvement for SHA-256 compiled with gcc and running on P4.     In the lack of assembler implementation I give the compiler all the     help it can possibly get:-)
      Final SHA-256/-512 touches. Extra md_len field in SHA[256|512]_CTX     reserves for truncated hash function output mode and makes SHA224     thread-safe. Next stop is integration with EVP and we're done...
      Typo in commentary section.
      Make sha-256/-512 naming in speed.c consistent with their names as they     will appear at EVP leyer.
      objects.txt update for SHA-224/-256/-384/-512. SHA-224 ids still appear     &quot;draft,&quot; but we have to start somewhere...
      EVP bindings to new SHA algorithms.
      Extend HMAC_MAX_MD_CBLOCK to accomodate SHA-512.
      Mention new SHA algorithms in CHANGES. This completes the integration.
      Working on HP-UX shared support...
      32-bit PA-RISC requires -Bsymbolic when linking libcrypto.sl. Without     this flag RAND_poll ends up in end-less loop calling RAND_add. But     don't ask me why...
      Minimal work-around for ./engine shared builds. &quot;Minimal&quot; means that I     think that proper Makefile clean-up is required.
      SHA fails to compile on x86_64 if compiled with custom flags, without     recommended -DMD32_REG_T=int in particular.     PR: 893     Submitted by: Michal Ludvig &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">michal-list at logix.cz</A>&gt;

      Add framework for yet another assembler module dubbed &quot;cpuid.&quot; Idea     is to have a placeholder to small routines, which can be written only     in assembler. In IA-32 case this includes processor capability     identification and access to Time-Stamp Counter. As discussed earlier     OPENSSL_ia32cap is introduced to control recently added SSE2 code     pathes (see docs/crypto/OPENSSL_ia32cap.pod). For the moment the     code is operational on ELF platforms only. I haven't checked it yet,     but I have all reasons to believe that Windows build should fail to     link too. I'll be looking into it shortly...
      This is so to say &quot;damage control&quot; for jumbo &quot;cpuid&quot; patch, see     <A HREF="http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=12493.">http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=12493.</A> Now all platform should     be operational, while SSE2 code pathes get engaged on ELF platforms     only.
      DLLEntryPoint is a collective name, not what linker looks for. However,     if we explicitly intruct the linker to set entry point, then we become     obliged to initialize run-time library. Instead we can pick name run-time     will call and such name is DllMain. Note that this applies to both     &quot;native&quot; Win32 environment and Cygwin:-)

      Improve ECB performance (48+14*rounds -&gt; 18+13*rounds) and reserve for     hand-coded zero-copy AES_cbc_encrypt.
      Default to AES u32 being unsinged int and not long. This improves cache     locality on 64-bit platforms (and fixes IA64 assembler-empowered build:-).     The choice is guarded by newly introduced AES_LONG macro, which needs     to be defined only on 16-bit platforms which we don't support (not that     I know of). Meaning that one could as well skip long option altogether.

      Allow for bn(64,32) on LP64 platforms.
      Switch 64-bit sparcv9 platforms from bn(64,64) to bn(64,32). This doesn't     have impact on performance, because amount of multiplications does not     increase with this switch, not on sparcv9 that is. On the contrary, it     actually improves performance, because it spares a load of instructions     used to chase carries. Not to mention that BN assembler modules can be     shared more freely between 32- and 64-bit builts.
      Add IALU-only bn_mul_mont for SPARCv9. See commentary section for details.

      As for inline vs. __inline. The original code implies that most compilers     understand inline, while WIN32 ones insist on __inline. Well, there are     other compilers that insist on __inline. At the same time it turned out     that most compilers understand both __inline and inline. I could find     only one that doesn't understand __inline, Sun C. In other words it seems     that __inline as preferred choice provides better coverage...

      sendto is reportedly picky about destination socket address length.     PR: 2114     Submitted by: Robin Seggelmann
      <A HREF="http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=19053">http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=19053</A> made me wonder if bind() and     connect() are as finicky as sendto() when it comes to socket address     length. As it turned out they are, therefore the fix. Note that you     can't reproduce the problem on Linux, it was failing on Solaris,     FreeBSD, most likely on more...
      ia64-mont.pl: addp4 is not needed when referring to stack (this is 32-bit     HP-UX thing).
      ia64-mont.pl: add shorter vector support (&quot;shorter&quot; refers to 512 bits and     less).
      bn_lcl.h: add MIPS III-specific BN_UMULT_LOHI as alternative to porting     crypto/bn/asm/mips3.s from IRIX. Performance improvement is not as     impressive as with complete assembler, but still... it's almost 2.5x     [on R5000].
      Minor updates to ppccap.c and ppccpuid.pl.
      apps/speed.c: limit loop counters to 2^31 in order to avoid overflows     in performance calculations. For the moment there is only one code     fast enough to suffer from this: Intel AES-NI engine.     PR: 2096

      This commit completes recent modular exponentiation optimizations on     x86_64 platform. It targets specifically RSA1024 sign (using ideas     from <A HREF="http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/239">http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/239</A>) and adds more than 10% on most     platforms. Overall performance improvement relative to 1.0.0 is ~40%     in average, with best result of 54% on Westmere. Incidentally ~40%     is average improvement even for longer key lengths.

      Don't use reserved name &quot;_encrypt&quot; for parameters;     instead I've picked &quot;enc&quot;, because that's what's in the prototypes.     (&quot;_encrypt&quot; is reserved only as an external name, but still     using it in an application doesn't look like good style to me --     and it certainly isn't if the point is just avoiding shadowing,     which is apparently why the previous name &quot;encrypt&quot; was changed.)

      Marked probable bug, pointed out by Anonymous.
      Added a comment pointing out the behaviour of &quot;openssl x509 -conf ...&quot;,     which cost me some time to find out about.
      Change type of various DES function arguments from des_cblock     (meaning pointer to char) to des_cblock * (meaning pointer to     array with 8 char elements), which allows the compiler to     do more typechecking.  (The changed argument types were of type     des_cblock * back in SSLeay, and a lot of ugly casts were     used then to turn them into pointers to elements; but it can be     done without those casts.)
      DES changes.
      Typo.
      Keep text lines less than 80 characters wide.

      Rename &quot;openssl x509&quot; option &quot;-config&quot; to &quot;-extfile&quot;, because it     doesn't have a default value like the &quot;-config&quot; options of other     openssl subprograms.

      For Solaris with old gcc versions (that don't understand     -mcpu=ultrasparc), don't silently step to solaris-sparc-gcc, which     would unnecessarily use less efficient assembler code.     Instead, use new configuration variant solaris-usparc-oldgcc;     this also means that someone who reads the output of ./config will     notice that it may be advantegeous to upgrade gcc.
      Bugfix: GCCVAR contains two lines (&quot;Reading specs ...&quot; and the actual     version), so we need        echo $GCCVAR | sed ...     instead of        echo &quot;$GCCVAR&quot; | sed ...     to process it as intended.
      Convert gcc version detection (for solaris-usparc-gcc) into a form     better suited for finding what went wrong in case that some compiler     versions create an output we can't parse.
      Note that the numbering scheme used to be different.
      Add -mv8 to solaris-usparc-oldgcc.
      Change self-description (mklink.pl is not just faster than the last     released version of mklink.sh -- the latter couldn't even handle     the ../../include/openssl case).
      Some solaris-usparc MD5 fixes.
      Don't install e_os.h in include/openssl, use it only as a local     include file.
      Add a kludge :-(     There were problems with putting e_os.h just into the top directory,     because the test programs are compiled within test/ in the &quot;standard&quot;     case in in their original directories in the makefile.one case;     and in the latter symlinks may not be available.
      It was a very bad idea to use #include &quot;../e_os.h&quot; -- when this occurs     in cryptlib.h (which is often included as &quot;../cryptlib.h&quot;), then the     question remains relative to which directory this is to be interpreted.     gcc went one further directory up, as intended; but makedepend thinks     differently, and so probably do some C compilers.  So the ../ must go away;     thus e_os.h goes back into include/openssl (but I now use     #include &quot;openssl/e_os.h&quot; instead of &lt;openssl/e_os.h&gt; to make the point) --     and we have another huge bunch of dependency changes.

      remove conflict indicator ...
      Update.
      More general definition for S_ISDIR (needed not only for VMS but     also for NeXT).
      &quot;linux-sparc&quot; configuration.
      linux-sparc
      Comments added.
      Use only -O, not -O3 for NeXTstep:
      mkdir -p is not fully portable (according to Marc Crispin,     NeXTstep creates a directory called -p); now mkdir-p.pl does its job.
      Mention mkdir-p.pl.
      Introduce &quot;BIO pairs&quot;, which (when finished) will relay data     so that the SSL library can be used for applications that     have to handle all the actual I/O themselves.
      Don't mix real tabs with tabs expanded as 8 spaces -- that's     a pain to read when using 4-space tabs.
      treat init properly
      Use the same path to perl in all #! lines in util.
      Use locking in a way that makes more sense.
      Fix for BIO pairs.
      Don't make assumptions on what the path looks like.
      Use mkdir-p.pl more efficiently.
      &quot;request&quot; added.
      Some pre-POSIX systems don't have unistd.h (but e.g. lib.c).     Allow configuring the name of that header file.
      Mention unistd.h.
      DES CBC change looks dubious to me.
      &quot;make update&quot; (added to top Makefile, and applied).
      Unify DES library: ncbc_enc.c wasn't used, but its content was almost     duplicated in cbc_enc.c (without IV updating) and in des_enc.c
      Update dependencies.
      des_cbc_encrypt / des_ncbc_encrypt issue.
      Delete unnecessary newlines in TABLE
      Oops, I forgot to add the dependency &quot;TABLE: Configure&quot;.
      Repair PEM_write_PrivateKey and PEM_write_bio_PrivateKey.
      tiny optical change
      Another &lt;unistd.h&gt; ...

      Avoid warning.
      Try to detect NeXT 3.3 (working Configure entry for this still missing)
      hpux-cc (HPUX 9.x) does not work with BN_LLONG (floating point exceptions).
      NeXT 3.3 can handle -O3 (3.0 can't).

      Changes for BSD/OS 4.
      BIO pairs.
      &quot;make update&quot;
      Avoid some warnings (on silly compilers).
      Bugfix.
      Provide fallback configurations for all hpux... configurations     (problems with BN_LLONG have been reported both for hpux-cc     and for hpux10-gcc).
      rc4_locl.h and bf_locl.h incorrectly defined _HEADER_...;     opensslconf.h always expects HEADER_... (no leading underscore).
      Comment adjusted to reality.
      long obsolete
      Obsolete.
      Don't try to use zero-byte buffers.
      Some people don't have /dev/fd/0 on Solaris, so use - instead.
      Don't access configuration files outside the source tree.
      Use same name in the definition as in the header file declaration :-/     (the extra &quot;get&quot; makes the name quite long, but otherwise it'd sound     as if you could request something rather than obtain information     about what the peer did).
      New function CRYPTO_num_locks.
      &quot;make update&quot;
      Clarification.
      &quot;make update&quot;

      Close another memory hole.
      Memory leak checks.
      Update TABLE.
      configuration change for debugging
      The Mingw32 configuration entry was missing one colon (found by     &quot;Zot O'Connor&quot; &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">zot at ZotConsulting.com</A>&gt;).     Also, Windows probably does not need the warning about multi-threading.
      Fix comments.     Submitted by: Anonymous
      With mingw32, use &quot;long long&quot; rather than &quot;_int64&quot; (the latter does     not work, at least the package mentioned in INSTALL.W32 does not know     about it).
      Don't use ...-oldgcc for egcs compiler.
      New functions SSL[_CTX]_{set,get}_mode; the initial set of mode flags is     SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE, SSL_MODE_ACCEPT_MOVING_WRITE_BUFFER.

      Looks like another memory leak ...
      typo in string
      fix memory leak in s3_clnt.c
      cosmetic changes
      Judging from various messages on the OpenSSL mailing lists, HP-UX 10     with cc (but not gcc) seems to work well with BN_LLONG; but -O4 is too     much.
      Fix option processing.     Submitted by: Sam Tetherow
      &quot;make clean&quot; has to delete date.h
      Add optional (compile-time configurable) time to CRYPTO_mem_leaks output.     This is much more helpful than the counter when doing tests with the library     interactively.
      Have CRYPTO_MDEBUG_TIME automatically set CRYPTO_MDEBUG,     and make it the default for some debugging configurations.
      New compile time option -DCRYPTO_MDEBUG_THREAD.
      SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE and SSL_MODE_ACCEPT_MOVING_WRITE_BUFFER     work as intended, both for SSLv2 and TLS.
      &quot;make TABLE&quot; (to follow recent Configure change)
      Auto-generated file -- this should not be under version control     (and the other */asm/*.cpp files are not)
      slight clean-up
      avoid -DPLATFORM=\&quot;...\&quot; and -DCFLAGS=\&quot;...\&quot; command lines,     use new file buildinf.h instead.
      Additional user data argument to pem_password_cb function type     and to lots of PEM_... functions.     Submitted by: Damien Miller &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">dmiller at ilogic.com.au</A>&gt;
      additional argument for key_callback
      Torture weak compilers less by not automatically including x509.h where     it is not needed.
      date.h no longer to be deleted by &quot;make clean&quot;
      ignore r586unix.cpp
      Don't include x509.h when we just need asn1.h
      summary of Andy's changes to Configure
      -DPLATFORM and -DCFLAGS command line arguments are no longer used.
      change CFLAGS to those given in Configure
      Use correct CFLAG definition for makefile.one builds.
      close files.
      Always use buildinf.h, which now includes the mk1mfinf.h data.     Using different files caused problems because the dependencies     in the Makefiles produced by mk1mf.pl were for the standard case,     i.e. mentioned buildinf.h and not mk1mfinf.h.
      correct error signalling for opendir() failure
      by request: let BN_dup(NULL) just return NULL
      don't prematurely shut down socket -- use SSL_shutdown
      SSL_shutdown was done too early.
      The SSL_CTX's cert structure is not relevant for the SSL     (because now SSL_new makes a copy).
      avoid cast
      fix previous modification -- if ssl-&gt;cert is NULL, don't follow the pointer.
      generate error message
      avoid some NO_&lt;cipher&gt; problems
      Revert previous change -- it was an accident.
      automatically use no-mdc2 if no-des is requested.
      Revert erroneous change.
      comment
      0.9.4 won't be completed in July ...
      improve clarity of instructions
      Add a wish.
      New function DSA_dup_DH, and fixes for bugs that were found     while implementing and using it.
      DSA_dup_DH.
      Dont' assume that something starting with '-' is a filename --     &quot;openssl gendsa -help&quot; now prints the usage summary, not error     messages that now file -help was found.
      fix the bug
      change formatting a bit
      add some more entries for 0.9.4
      New option &quot;-crlf&quot; to s_client and s_server which tells them to convert     LFs into CRLFs when forwarding data from stdin to the TLS connection.     This is necessary for properly talking HTTP.     Because of the code freeze this change is by default disabled for now;     without -DAPPS_CRLF, the code is exactly as before.
      0.9.4
      more consistent formatting
      add comments
      Comments.
      spelling
      Provide fixed seed for parameter generation to speed up -dhe1024.
      -crlf option.
      BIO_write and BIO_read could, in theory, return -2.
      Updates.     Prototypes and constant declarations for non-copying reads and writes for     BIO pairs (which is totally untested as of now, so I don't yet commit     the actual source code, but reserve the numbers to avoid conflicts).
      Fix typo.
      Submitted by: Lidong Zhou &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">ldzhou at cs.cornell.edu</A>&gt;
      Remove -DWINDOWS in debug configuration.
      Disable the text about foo.h =&gt; openssl/foo.h.     Everyone should have got it by now.
      Return 0 for succesful exit when -noout is used.
      Really undo the base64 change so that make test survives
      Fix horrible (and hard to track down) bug in ssl23_get_client_hello:     In case of a restart, v[0] and v[1] were incorrectly initialised.     This was interpreted by ssl3_get_client_key_exchange as an RSA decryption     failure (don't ask me why) and caused it to create a _random_ master key     instead (even weirder), which obviously led to incorrect input to     ssl3_generate_master_secret and thus caused &quot;block cipher pad is     wrong&quot; error messages from ssl3_enc for the client's Finished message.     Arrgh.
      Handle &quot;#if 0&quot; correctly (I hope)
      Use closesocket macro consistently, not close directly, for easier     portability.     Submitted by: Lennart B&#195;&#165;ng
      -no_dhe option for ssltest.c
      Fix server behaviour when facing backwards-compatible client hellos.
      Make previous bugfix actually work
      use explicit constant 11 just once
      Reinitialize global variables when necessary (for monolith application).
      Reinitialize conf to NULL whenver ca application is started.     Submitted by: Lennart Bang
      Non-copying interface to BIO pairs.     It's still totally untested ...
      some more patches for avoiding problems with non-automatic variables
      Re-enable message about transition &lt;foo.h&gt; =&gt; &lt;openssl/foo.h&gt;     because various programs are not updated that often     and hence still expect header files names without the openssl/ prefix.
      Truncate message about &quot;new&quot; include filenames
      typo
      Use non-copying BIO interface in ssltest.c.
      &quot;make update&quot;
      Repair another bug in s23_get_client_hello:     tls1 did not survive to restarts, so get rid of it.
      Fix yet another bug for client hello handling.
      Set s-&gt;version correctly for &quot;natural&quot; SSL 3.0 client hello
      Add some debug-solaris-...-cc configurations.
      typo in a comment
      Update dependencies.
      Document -startdate and -enddate in usage summary.
      Keep line lengths &lt; 80 characters.
      typo
      Fix typo that I introduced when reformatting lines.
      Use a temporary file, not a pipe, for BN test because there are some     broken bc's around.
      Bugfix: avoid opening CAfile when it's NULL.
      Honor BUFSIZZ definition in s_server, don't use tiny 32 byte     buffer (which leads to truncation of client cipher list).
      Fix typo in error message.
      new control code BIO_C_RESET_READ_REQUEST
      &quot;make update&quot;
      Pass $(RANLIB) when doing &quot;make install&quot; in subdirectories;     rsaref needs ist.
      Use of DEVRANDOM must be #ifdef'ed (the #ifdef was commented out     between SSLeay 0.8.1b and 0.9.0b with no apparent reason).     If we *want* an error when DEVRANDOM is not defined (it always is with     the current e_os.h) we should use #error.
      Respect PEX_LIBS and EX_LIBS when building binaries     (needed for RSAREF builds)
      Improve support for running everything as a monolithic application.
      Update Borland C++ builder support.
      Report an error from X509_STORE_load_locations     when X509_LOOKUP_load_file or X509_LOOKUP_add_dir failed.
      Various randomness handling bugfixes and improvements --     some utilities that should have used RANDFILE did not,     and -rand handling was broken except in genrsa.
      New file app_rand.c with some functionality used in various openssl     applications.
      Don't be overly paranoid.
      Warn about RANDFILE being overwritten.
      Make md_rand.c more robust.
      Always hash the pid in the first iteration in ssleay_rand_bytes,     don't try to detect fork()s by looking at getpid().     The reason is that threads sharing the same memory can have different     PIDs; it's inefficient to run RAND_seed each time a different thread     calls RAND_bytes.
      Avoid some warnings.
      Undo silly change.
      Avoid deadlock.
      Store verify_result with sessions to avoid potential security hole.
      Restore traditional SSL_get_session behaviour so that s_client and s_server     don't leak tons of memory.
      Add functions des_set_key_checked, des_set_key_unchecked.     Never use des_set_key (it depends on the global variable des_check_key),     but usually des_set_key_unchecked.     Only destest.c bothered to look at the return values of des_set_key,     but it did not set des_check_key -- if it had done so,     most checks would have failed because of wrong parity and     because of weak keys.
      Use des_set_key_unchecked, not des_set_key.
      Useless files deleted -- they were just copies of files of the same name     in the apps/ directory (which were recently changed).
      Add missing semicolon to make compiler happy, and switch back     from MemCheck_start() to CRYPTO_mem_ctrl(CRYPTO_MEM_CHECK_ON)     because that is what applications should use     (MemCheck_start/stop never really worked for applications     unless CRYPTO_MDEBUG was defined both when compiling the library     and when compiling the application, so probably we should     get rid of it).
      Add a comment.
      Point out that openssl-bugs is public.
      Avoid shadowing p to make the compiler happy.
      - Don't assume that int and size_t have the same representation       (and that malloc can be called with an int argument).     - Use proper prototypes (with argument list) for various function pointers,       avoid casts  (however there are still many such cases left in these files).     - Avoid collissions in app_info_cmp if sizeof int != sizeof long.     - Use CRYPTO_LOCK_MALLOC in mem_dbg.c.
      fix typos and other little errors ...
      Rename        CRYPTO_add_info    =&gt; CRYPTO_push_info        CRYPTO_remove_info =&gt; CRYPTO_pop_info     in the hope that these names are more descriptive;     and &quot;make update&quot;.
      Correct spelling, and don't abuse grave accent as left quote     (which was allowed by old ASCII definitions but is not compatible     with ISO 8859-1, ISO 10646 etc.).
      fix comment
      Delete NO_PROTO section (which apparently was just a typo for NOPROTO --     if anyone had actually ever needed that they should have fixed this typo)
      Fix SSL_CTX_add_session: When two SSL_SESSIONs have the same ID,     they can sometimes be different memory structures.
      Don't request client certificate in anonymous ciphersuites     except when following the specs is bound to fail.
      Rename CA.pl to CA.pl.in (no actual changes), and let Configure     set the #! line with the path to Perl.
      Slight code cleanup for handling finished labels.
      Use prototypes.
      Use separate arrays for certificate verify and for finished hashes.
      Use less complicated arrangement for data strutures related to Finished     messages.
      New functions SSL_get_finished, SSL_get_peer_finished.
      add &quot;UnixWare&quot;, treated like &quot;unixware&quot;
      add V_CRYPTO_MDEBUG_ALL     Submitted by:     Reviewed by:     PR:
      make no-des and no-rc2 work.
      apps/openssl.cnf and the documentation say it's &quot;nombstr&quot;,     but crypto/asn1/a_strnid.c had &quot;nombchar&quot;.
      CA.pl is now generated automatically (using CA.pl.in as input)
      Use basename instead of complicated sed line.
      Unify doc/openssl.pod and doc/man/openssl.pod, which were almost the     same and now are identical.     The next step will be to delete doc/openssl.pod, this is just     to see the individual CVS deltas.
      superseded by doc/man/openssl.pod
      s_client and s_server now have their own man pages.
      Clean up some of the SSL server code.
      The buffer in ss3_read_n cannot actually occur because it is never     called with max &gt; n when extend is set.
      add check for internal error
      add dependency and auto-generation rule for bn_prime.h     (created by bn_prime.pl, which now prints the copyright/license     note as found in bn_prime.h)
      Turn BN_prime_checks into a macro.
      Note about CRYPTO_malloc_init
      Use CRYPTO_push_info to find a memory leak in pkcs12.c.
      note about things still to do with RAND_bytes
      slightly change usage information
      Use CRYPTO_push_info to track down memory leak     (only the CRYPTO_push_info's in the apps/ directory     are included in the CVS commit, not all those I used     in crypto/)
      Avoid shadowing variables,     and re-enable seeding with more data than read from DEVRANDOM -- just     don't pretend it contains entropy.
      Avoid some warnings, and run &quot;make update&quot;.
      - Pseudo-seed the PRNG in programs used for &quot;make test&quot;       because otherwise BN_rand will fail unless DEVRANDOM works,       which causes the programs to dump core because they       don't check the return value of BN_rand (and if they       did, we still couldn't test anything).
      In EVP_PKEY_assign[_...], return 0 for an error when they     &quot;key&quot; is NULL.
      Let &quot;make test&quot; survive without DEVRANDOM     (and rename a target in test/Makefile.ssl to make it     easier to guess the name of the file executed by it)
      Delete &quot;random&quot; file .rnd in &quot;make clean&quot;.
      Enable memory checking earlier (we correctly free everything     except for the BIO through which we print the memory leak list,     and the leak printing function ignores this one block).
      RAND_bytes's return values is 0 for an error, not -1.
      add &quot;randomness&quot;
      In ssl3_read_n, set rwstate to SSL_NOTHING when the requested     number of bytes could be read.
      SSL_R_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL (as in s23_clnt.c) for SSL 2 when     NO_SSL2 is defined, not SSL_R_UNKNOWN_PROTOCOL.
      Define WINDOWS.
      Define WINDOWS for Mingw32 and Cygwin.
      Rename lst1 to list1 to avoid name conflict on some platforms.
      Define WINDOWS in all Mingw32 cases.
      mention manual pages
      doc/man moved to doc/apps
      Don't &quot;goto err&quot; in client_master_key because no such label exists;     just return -1 as in other error cases.
      add ERR_print_errors after &quot;end&quot; label.
      In RAND_write_file, truncate the file to the no. of bytes written     (we're now using fopen(..., &quot;rb+&quot;) instead of fopen(..., &quot;wb&quot;),     so the file is not truncated automatically).
      Avoid integer overflow in entropy counter.     Slightly clarify the RAND_... documentation.
      change comments
      update PRNG documentation/comments
      As ftruncate is not availabe on all platforms, switch back to     opening the output file with &quot;wb&quot; to truncate it except on VMS     (where the file now keeps its original length because it is opened     with &quot;rb+&quot; -- does VMS have ftruncate?)
      Under VMS, ftruncate should be available
      The des_xcbc_encrypt apparently always fails.     Workaround so that &quot;make test&quot; continues anyway.
      RAND_pseudo_bytes is good enough for encryption IVs,     we should not need RAND_bytes (and we cannot use the latter     unless we load a seed file)
      RAND_load_file(..., -1) now means &quot;read the complete file&quot;;     this is what we now use to read $RANDFILE / $HOME/.rnd.     (Previously, after 'cat'ting lots of stuff into .rnd     only the first MB would be looked at.)
      Give the correct e-mail address even though the message is not quite serious
      Document RAND_load_file change.
      Improve clarity.
      Avoid a race condition.
      New manual page.

      Make sure the return value of by_file_ctrl(..., X509_L_FILE_LOAD, ...)     aka X509_LOOKUP_load_file(...) is always 0 or 1, not the counter     returned from the recently introduced function X509_load_cert_crl_file.     X509_STORE_load_locations expects X509_LOOKUP_load_file to return 1 on     success, and possibly there's other software that relies on this too.
      add missing 'static'
      Avoid potential conflicts between #defines in opensslconf.h and     defines when compiling applications, and allow applications to     select what #defines to enable -- OPENSSL_EXLUCDE_DEFINES     enables the &quot;#define NO_whatever&quot; stuff only, which avoids     potential severe confusion caused by &quot;#define _REENTRANT&quot; when     opensslconf.h is not the first header file #included.

      Move MAC computations for Finished from ssl3_read_bytes into     ssl3_get_message, which is more logical (and avoids a bug,     in addition to the one that I introduced yesterday :-)     and makes Microsoft &quot;fast SGC&quot; less special.     MS SGC should still work now without an extra state of its own     (it goes directly to SSL3_ST_SR_CLNT_HELLO_C, which is the usual state     for reading the body of a Client Hello message), however this should     be tested to make sure, and I don't have a MS SGC client.

      typo
      another typo
      Change to code generated by 'dhparam -C':
      Always use fixed DH parameters created with 'dhparam -C',     don't dynamically create them.  This allows using ssltest     for approximate performance comparisons:        $ time ./ssltest -num 50 -tls1 -cert ../apps/server2.pem \          [-no_dhe|-dhe1024dsa|-dhe1024]     (server2.pem contains a 1024 bit RSA key, the default has only     512 bits.) Note that these timings contain both the server's and     the client's computations, they are not a good indicator for     server workload in different configurations.
      Mention -ign_eof.
      Use signed types where necessary, and add missing functionality     to make SSL_nread0 work.
      On NeXT, ssize_t is int, not long (see &lt;sys/types.h&gt; -- the definition     is activated only when _POSIX_SOURCE is defined).

      typo
      another typo
      Remove &quot;Makefile.uni&quot; files and some related stuff.     This was meant for building individual ciphers separately;     but nothing of this is maintained, it does not work     because we rely on central configuration by the Configure     utility with &lt;openssl/opensslconf.h&gt; etc., so the files     are only wasting space and time.
      Use correct function names in SSLerr macros.
      Insert a comment: This is one of the few files in this directory     that is actually used (even though it may not appear so at first     sight).
      SSL_ALLOW_ADH no longer has a meaning.

      Avoid leaking memory in thread_hash (and enable memory leak detection     for it).
      Add missing #include.
      Fix a memory leak, and don't generate inappropriate error message     when PEM_read_bio_X509_REQ fails.
      Note apps/x509.c bugfixes.
      When open()ing 'file' in RAND_write_file, don't use O_EXCL.     This is superfluous now that we don't have to avoid creating     multiple versions of the file on VMS (because older versions     are now deleted).

      No need to abort if c_rehash fails here (e.g. because Perl is not where     it is expected).
      Speed up DH with small generator.
      Use the equivalent of a sliding window (without precomputation     because we're only handling words anyway) in BN_mod_exp_mont_word     making it a little faster for very small exponents,     and adjust the performance gain estimate in CHANGES according     to slightly more thorough measurements.     (15% faster than BN_mod_exp_mont for &quot;large&quot; base,     20% faster than BN_mod_exp_mont for small base.)
      Add entry that Richard forgot.
      Slightly faster DSA verification (BN_mod_exp2_mont),     marginally faster BN_mod_exp for 1024 bit exponents.
      Accept -F4 option in lower case, which is what the usage information     says one should use.
      Harmonize indentation.
      Another attempt to allow compiling on SunOS 4.*.
      Comment for increased code clarity.
      Comment about bcopy on SunOS 4.x.
      BN_mod_exp_mont_word entry:     Don't give performance gain estimates that appear to be more precise     than they really are, especially when they are wrong     (2/(1/1.15 + 1) = ca. 1.0698).
      In longer tests with g=2, DH exchange does not become quite as fast     as expected -- maybe it's the different processor, maybe my     previous timings were too inaccurate.
      Use BN_CTX_end when exiting early from BN_mod_exp_mont_word because     BN_mod_exp_atalla could be used.
      This probably fixes a BN_rshift bug.
      Report &quot;error&quot; (usually just &quot;File exists&quot;, which is harmless)     when symlink() fails.

      Avoid unnecessary links and incomplete program file in apps/.
      In BN_mod_exp_mont_word, avoid one application of BN_MOD_MUL_WORD,     and for small 'a' also a couple of calls to     BN_mod_mul_montgomery(r, r, r, ...).

      'make update'
      Fix X509_STORE_CTX_init.  Make indentation more consistent.  Dump core less often.
      More indentation consistency: for (), while (), if (), return ()     usually get a space between keyword and opening paranthesis     so that they don't look like function calls, where no space is     used.
      Another round of indentation changes: Position braces consistently,     add some whitespace for 'if ()', 'for ()', 'while ()' to distinguish     keywords from function names, and finally remove parens around return     values (why be stingy with whitespace but fill the source code     with an abundance of parentheses that are not needed to structure     expressions for readability?).
      Another superfluous pair of parentheses.

      Implement BN_kronecker test.
      Expand expspeed.c to make BN_kronecker timings.     This caused a segmentation fault in calls to malloc, so I cleaned up     bn_lib.c a little so that it is easier to see what is going on.     The bug turned out to be an off-by-one error in BN_bin2bn.
      BN_bin2bn did *not* contain an off-by-one error;     I'm still investigating what caused the segementation fault     (maybe &quot;make clean; make&quot; will cure it ...).     But BN_bin2bn should always reset ret-&gt;neg.

But even if this is avoided, there are still segmentation violations     (during one of the BN_free()s at the end of test_kron     in some cases, in other cases during BN_kronecker, or     later in BN_sqrt; choosing a different exponentiation     algorithm in bntest.c appears to influence when the SIGSEGV     takes place).
      Remove randomness from the test. These constants give me a segment     violation in test_kron on a 32 bit system.
      Fix BN_rshift, which caused lots of trouble.
      Fix the recently introduced test that checks if the result is 0
      COMP_zlib should always be declared, even if it is not functional.

      Workaround for broken (or missing) bc.
      Add a comment.
      Use bc's &quot;print&quot; feature whenever it is available,     not just on certain platforms.
      Printing &quot;verify ...&quot; should not be counted as a test for the     &quot;xxx tests passed&quot; message.
      Faster BN_mod_sqrt algorithm for p == 5 (8).
      BN_mod_sqrt documentation/comment
      Move 'q-&gt;neg = 0' to those places where it is needed     (just in cases someone uses a negative modulus)
      Sign-related fixes (and tests).
      TEST_MUL and TEST_SQR added.
      Fix some things that look like bugs.
      Placeholder for SCO bc bug detection
      Don't throw away bctest's error messages.
      Use continuation lines in test/bctest as far as it is possible     to dermine what the expression should look like.     Apparently CVS does not like lines longer than about 2^10 characters.
      Change/add comments
      Update.
      First step towards SSL_peek fix.
      The BN_mul bug test apparently is no longer needed
      typo
      Very few in the &quot;README&quot; is up-to-date
      The C version of bn_sub_part_words is needed not only     in NO_ASM configurations
      Locking issues.
      If CONF_get_string returns NULL and we want to tolerate this     (e.g., use a default), we have to call ERR_clear_error().
      Simplify preprocessor statements.
      When mentioning features that don't exist in current releases of     OpenSSL (such as the new undocumented '-prexit' option to s_client),     the FAQ should point out that they don't: The FAQ is not just part     of the release, it's current version is also published on the web.
      undo previous change: '-prexit' is already available in current versions of s_client
      Obtain lock CRYPTO_LOCK_RSA before creating BN_MONT_CTX     structures and setting rsa-&gt;_method_mod_{n,p,q}.
      Comment correction.
      Import s2_pkt.c wbuf fixes from OpenSSL_0_9_6-stable branch.
      Add a comment (intended change)
      Don't hold CRYPTO_LOCK_RSA during time-consuming operations.
      fix indentation
      Split a CHANGES entry so that one of the halves matches the     corresponding new entry in the OpenSSL_0_9_6-stable branch.
      Don't access non-existing element buf[256], use buf[255] instead.
      Fix SSL_peek and SSL_pending.
      Finish SSL_peek/SSL_pending fixes.
      Get rid of unused error code.
      Change prototypes for new CRYPTO_..._mem_ex_functions functions so     that they match the function definitions (namely, remove file/line     parameters from free_func).
      Fix C code generate by 'openssl dsaparam -C'.
      Add a pointer to digest options in the description of -fingerprint.
      'char' argument to islower must be converted to 'unsigned char'
      Add SSLEAY_DIR argument code for SSLeay_version.     Add '-d' option for 'openssl version' (included in '-a').
      make indentation consistent
      Last time I asked, no-one appeared to remember if these &quot;NEEDS PATCH&quot;     entries are still current or what they are about:
      Add new items:     - 0.9.6a is under development     - a couple of illegal includes of &lt;openssl/e_os.h&gt; should be purged     - ex_data sucks
      Use $(PERL) in place of hard-coded perl
      Pass ${PERL} down to the Makefile in sub-directory &quot;test&quot; in     &quot;make tests&quot;
      It's silly to use a different default for PERL than in the top     Makefile.  (The default is never actually used though because     the top Makefile passes its value of PERL down to sub-Makefiles.)
      After discussion with Richard, change the new API for extended memory     allocation callbacks so that it is no longer visible to applications     that these live at a different call level than conventional memory     allocation callbacks.
      No functional change, but slightly improved code clarity.
      New -newreq-nodes option to CA.pl.
      Remove &quot;AVAILABLE PATCH&quot; that has now been applied.
      When we are waiting for user action, we should say this explicitly.
      note strncpy problem
      isspace must be used only on *unsigned* chars
      New 'openssl ca -status &lt;serial&gt;' and 'openssl ca -updatedb'     commands.
      Disable RegQueryValueEx() call.     Problem reported by &quot;Wolfgang Marczy&quot; &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">WMarczy at topcall.co.at</A>&gt;     in a message to openssl-dev (19 Dec 2000 13:40:51 +0100).
      New '-extfile' option for 'openssl ca'.     This allows keeping extensions in a separate configuration file.
      Fix openssl passwd -1
      More on the e_os.h mess ...
      Use OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms instead of the backwards compatibility     alias SSLeay_add_all_algorithms
      For improved compatibility with 'strange' certificates, add some     digest aliases (as found in OpenSSL_add_all_digests).
      EVP_add_digest_alias additions to SS_library_init
      Update &quot;OAEP reconsidered&quot; comment
      update
      Comment and indentation
      Remove serial number file during 'make clean'.
      Include string.h (whis is in all relevant standards) instead of     memory.h (which is not).
      don't dump core
      Avoid coredumps for CONF_get_...(NULL, ...)
      platform specific CFLAGS don't belong into this Makefile
      Integrate my implementation of a countermeasure against     Bleichenbacher's DSA attack.  With this implementation, the expected     number of iterations never exceeds 2.
      oops -- remove observation code
      Change comments.  (The expected number of iterations in BN_rand_range     never exceeds 1.333...).
      Another comment change.  (Previous comment does not apply     for range = 11000000... or range = 100000...)
      add linux-s390 configuration (based on information submitted by     Denis Beauchemin &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">Denis.Beauchemin at Courrier.USherb.ca</A>&gt;)
      fix editing error
      Simplify BN_rand_range
      use case-insensitive comparison in set_table_opts     (similar to how arguments such as -inform/-outform specifications     are treated)
      disable stdin buffering in load_cert
      Add German SiG root certificates (extracted from the official cert registry     file <A HREF="http://www.nrca-ds.de/ftp/pkd.ttp,">http://www.nrca-ds.de/ftp/pkd.ttp,</A> which contains a total of 288     certificates issued by the RegPT so far)
      Oops: It's RegTP, not RegPT ...
      Add uid.{c,o}
      Memory leak detection bugfixes for multi-threading.
      Fix BN_[pseudo_]rand: 'mask' must be used even if top=-1.
      update
      honour '-no_tmp_rsa'
      include e_os.h as &quot;openssl/e_os.h&quot; (as elsewhere)
      undo previous change: &quot;e_os.h&quot; is now the official name for the file     to include (but the OpenSSL_0_9_6-stable branche still has     inconsistencies)
      e_os.h problems have been solved in the main branch.
      EC_set_half and the 'h' component of struct bn_ec_struct are unnecessary.     The computations for which h was used can be done more efficiently     by using BN_rshift1.
      increase emailAddress_max
      New option '-subj arg' for 'openssl req' and 'openssl ca'.  This     sets the subject name for a new request or supersedes the     subject name in a given request.
      Move ec.h to ec2.h because it is not compatible with what we will use.
      Add more EC vaporware (empty source code files I missed in my     previous commit).
      Add yet another (still empty) source code file that I forgot.
      Another file I had forgotten to add.
      Some declarations that outline what I intend to implement.
      Change comments.
      Add EC_GROUP_new_GFp prototype.
      Add BN_CTX arguments where appropriate.
      New function declarations.
      'is_at_infinity' tests don't need a BN_CTX.
      Change obj_... generation so that it does not generate rubbish or     abort with errors if no name is defined for some object, which was the     case for 'pilotAttributeType 27'.
      Add a few 'const's
      Implement dispatcher for EC_GROUP and EC_POINT method functions.
      Fix ERR_R_... problems.
      In clear_free, clear the complete structure just in case     the method misses something.
      Oops ...
      extra_data 'mixin'.     (This will be used for Lim/Lee precomputation data.)
      The next bunch of vaporware.
      Optimized EC_METHODs need specific 'set_curve' and 'free' functions.
      ..._init functions are method-specific too     (they can't do much useful, but they will have to set pointers     to NULL)
      Some actual method functions (not enough yet to use the EC library, though),     including EC arithmetics derived from Lenka Fibikova's code (with some     additional optimizations).
      More method functions.
      More method functions for EC_GFp_simple_method.
      More 'TODO' items.
      Let EC_POINT_copy do nothing if dest==src
      Get rid of '#define ERR_file_name __FILE__', which is unnecessary indirection.     (It cannot possibly help to avoid duplicate 'name of file' strings     in object files because the preprocessor does not work at object file     level.)
      Order ERR_load_... calls like the stuff in err.h.
      Integrate ectest.c (which does not yet do anything).
      Sort openssl.ec, the configuration file for mkerr.pl.
      Throw out *all* absolute pathnames, not matter what they look like.     The filenames we are interested in for Makefile dependencies     are always relative.
      Integrate ec_err.[co].
      Constify BN_value_one.
      avoid compiler warning
      Hide BN_CTX structure details.
      Comment
      Bugfix: previously the serial number file could turn negative     because an incompletely initialized ASN1_INTEGER was used.
      More method functions for elliptic curves,     and an ectest.c that actually tests something.
      Fixes to make 'no-ec' work (it should not turn 'objects' into 'objts' for example)
      Implement EC_GFp_mont_method.
      Avoid problems with multi-line NAME sections.
      add ssl23_peek
      ssl23_peek
      Fix ec_GFp_simple_cmp.
      Consistently use 'void *' for SSL read, peek and write functions.
      Workaround for solaris64 linking problem (explicit &quot;ar rs&quot; is needed     to create a symbol table).
      Instead of telling both 'make' and the user that ranlib     errors can be tolerated, hide the error from 'make'.     This gives shorter output both if ranlib fails and if     it works.
      More EC stuff, including EC_POINTs_mul() for simultaneous scalar     multiplication of an arbitrary number of points.
      Remove files from Lenka's EC implementation.
      comment and error code update
      Change timing output: We don't have &quot;exponents&quot; here, curves are     considered additive
      use fflush
      handle negative scalars correctly when doing point multiplication
      Add functions EC_POINT_mul and EC_GROUP_precompute.     The latter does nothing for now, but its existence means     that applications can request precomputation when appropriate.
      Timings are not supposed to be enabled by default ...
      Forcibly enable memory leak checking during &quot;make test&quot;
      EC_METHOD based on bn_mont2 (not used in the library)
      Add various X9.62 OIDs. (GF(2^n) mostly left out.)
      Rename function EC_GROUP_precompute to EC_GROUP_precompute_mult,     which indicate its purpose more clearly.
      fix memory leak in err.c
      Use err_clear_data macro
      typo
      Fix: return 0 if no error occured.
      The former ULTRASPARC preprocessor symbol is now called     OPENSSL_SYSNAME_ULTRASPARC, so we'd better check for that one
      More error_data memory leaks
      error codes are longs, not ints
      avoid infinite loop
      Completely remove mont2 stuff.     It does not appear to be faster than the current Montgomery code     except for very small moduli (somewhere between 192 and 224 bits     in a 64-bit Sun environment, and even less than 192 bits     on 32 bit systems).
      Explicitly ignore the exit code of ./bctest.  Usually the shell     ignores it anyway in command substitution, but Ultrix reportedly     aborted the test when bctest returned 1.
      Update.
      Table for window sizes.
      Increase boundaries in EC_window_bits_for_scalar_size table.
      Tag EC_GFp_{nist,recp}_method as &quot;NOEXIST&quot; because they have     not yet been implemented.
      Update docs.
      Harmonize CHANGES and STATUS files between the 0.9.6a branch and     the trunk to keep diffs small.
      Add missing '#ifndef OPENSSL_NO_DSA'.
      Fix bctest, and add a workaround that should solve the problem with     FreeBSD's /bin/sh.
      News for 0.9.6a.
      For -WWW, fix test for &quot;..&quot; directory references (and avoid warning for     index -1).
      this time *really* fix the /../ check ...
      avoid buffer overflow
      This change should be suitable as a workaround for the Solaris x86     compiler bug reported in &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">01032110293775.22278 at weba3.iname.net</A>&gt;     (the '++seq[i]' condition is evaluated as 256 rather than 0     when the previous value is 255).
      Make sure OPENSSL_SYS_... is defined when we need it.
      Fix warnings.
      don't use shell functions
      Don't use 'tt' uninitialized when reporting an error     (we don't have an ASN1_TEMPLATE to complain about at this stage,     so  errtt == NULL  should be OK)
      Avoid assert() in the library.
      '||', '&amp;&amp;' and 'test -x' apparently don't work on Ultrix;     also 'test' appears to be available as '[' only in 'if' conditions.
      avoid '||' since Ultrix apparently doesn't understand it
      binary algorithm for modular inversion
      code documentation
      comment
      update (0.9.6a)
      Adjust BN_mod_inverse algorithm selection according to experiments on     Ultra-Sparcs (both 32-bit and 64-bit compilations)
      Mention automatically queried EGD sockets (OpenSSL 0.9.7).
      Add information on 0.9.6a (in a form such that the list can be     verified by looking at 'diff -u ../openssl-0.9.6a/CHANGES CHANGES')
      update from 0.9.6a
      undo previous change ...
      update so that changes going into the 0.9.6 tree can be logged

      bctest changes for Ultrix (don't return 1 from bctest, otherwise make aborts)
      .rnd issues
      fix an old entry
      restore change undone in 1.831 (apparently by accident)
      increase DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE (4K instead of just 1K)
      Fix Bleichenbacher PKCS #1 1.5 countermeasure.     (The attack against SSL 3.1 and TLS 1.0 is impractical anyway,     otherwise this would be a security relevant patch.)
      when checking OAEP, signal just a single kind of 'decoding error'
      OAEP fix
      Earlier OpenSSL versions printed prompts to stderr.     In the new crypto/ui/, this was changed into tty (which is usually     /dev/tty), i.e. the FILE * used for reading passwords from the user.     However stdio buffering for read/write streams is not without pitfalls     (passwords would be echoed on some systems).     To avoid problems, split tty into tty_in and tty_out (which are     opened separately).
      Add directory name to the entry on /crypto/ui/.
      even use of default engines leaks memory
      For MSDOS, the tty filename still is &quot;con&quot;, not &quot;/dev/tty&quot; ...
      pay attention to blocksize before attempting decryption
      Translate into valid C (don't call functions with wrong prototypes).
      DSA verification should insist that r and s are in the allowed range.
      Entry for Andy's mips3.s fix.
      Call ENGINE_cleanup() to avoid memory leak.
      Engine memory leaks have been fixed by now.
      Align with 0.9.6-stable CHANGES file, and make some corrections.
      Precomputation will not necessarily be LIm-Lee precomputation.
      In version numbers, there is just one &quot;M&quot; nybble.
      Fix PRNG.
      comment change
      For consistency with the terminology used in my SAC2001 paper, avoid     the term &quot;simultaneous multiplication&quot; (which -- acording to the     paper, at least -- applies only to certain methods which we don't use     here)
      Avoid race condition.
      avoid warnings
      add a comment
      always reject data &gt;= n
      md_rand.c thread safety
      Don't preserve existing keys in DH_generate_key.
      DH key generation should not use a do ... while loop,     or bogus DH parameters can be used for launching DOS attacks
      Undo DH_generate_key() change: s3_srvr.c was using it correctly
      length of secret exponent is needed only when we create one
      remove a comma
      Reinsert typedef'ed names for structs to help those trying to read the     sourcecode (including fgrep)
      More typedef'd struct names as search targets
      Bugfix: larger message size in ssl3_get_key_exchange() because     ServerKeyExchange message may be skipped.
      add missing link
      rearrange #includes because trying to include &lt;crypto/cryptodev.h&gt;     is a bad idea if OPENSSL_OPENBSD_DEV_CRYPTO is not defined
      Use uniformly chosen witnesses for Miller-Rabin test     (by using new BN_pseudo_rand_range function)
      Rename recently introduced functions for improved code clarity:           [DR]SA_up  =&gt;  [DR]SA_up_ref
      delete redundant ERR_load_CRYPTO_strings() prototype
      OpenSSL copyright notices ...
      CHANGES should list all API changes relevant for applications     (here: X509_STORE_CTX_init())
      changing something requires a write lock, not a read lock
      Now that we have ERR_unload_strings(), ERR_load_ERR_strings() must     always load its strings because they might have been unloaded     since the 'init' flag was deleted.
      typo
      Solaris &lt;string.h&gt; does not declare 'strdup' if _XOPEN_SOURCE is     defined.
      -mcpu=i486 vs. -m486 ...
      Oops, wrong line
      Oops^2: It was the correct line, but an incorrect change.
      Renaming DH_up to DH_up_ref does not warrant a CHANGES entry of its own     as the functions were only introduced a couple of days ago.
      Mention DSO_up =&gt; DSO_up_ref renaming
      fix formatting so that the file can be view with any tab-width
      improve OAEP check
      Totally get rid of CRYPTO_LOCK_ERR_HASH.
      Avoid strdup.
      The various hash #includes in rand_lcl.h *are* needed despite     &lt;openssl/evp.h&gt; is now used (MD_DIGEST_LENGTH definitions!).     No need to include such headers directly in md_rand.c.
      Fix apps/openssl.c and ssl/ssltest.c so that they use     CRYPTO_set_mem_debug_options() instead of CRYPTO_dbg_set_options(),     which is the default implementation of the former and should usually     not be directly used by applications (at least if we assume that the     options accepted by the default implementation will also be meaningful     to any other implementations).
      Delete pointless casts
      copyright
      Get rid of hazardous EVP_DigestInit_dbg/EVP_DigestInit case     distinction (which does not work well because if CRYPTO_MDEBUG is     defined at library compile time, it is not necessarily defined at     application compile time; and memory debugging now can be reconfigured     at run-time anyway).  To get the intended semantics, we could just use     the EVP_DigestInit_dbg unconditionally (which uses the caller's     __FILE__ and __LINE__ for memory leak debugging), but this would make     memory debugging inconsistent.  Instead, callers can use     CRYPTO_push_info() to track down memory leaks.

      New function SSL_renegotiate_pending().     New option SSL_OP_NO_SESSION_RESUMPTION_ON_RENEGOTIATION.
      Bugfix: correct cleanup after sending a HelloRequest
      Disable session related stuff in SSL_ST_OK case of ssl3_accept if we     just sent a HelloRequest.
      bugfix: handle HelloRequest received during handshake correctly
      crypto/idea and crypto/rijndael were missing in the list of     directories that may have been deleted
      The 'no-rijndael' option must define OPENSSL_NO_AES because that is     what we look for in crypto/evp.

      'openssl speed' does not include AES support yet
      'openssl rsa' etc. should include AES support in addition to DES

      Fix ssl3_get_message handle message fragmentation correctly.
      make sure .rnd exists
      Change ssl3_get_message and the functions using it so that complete     'Handshake' protocol structures are kept in memory, including     'msg_type' and 'length'.
      For consistency, set s-&gt;init_num in the 'reuse_message' case     (if s23_srvr.c faked the message, s-&gt;init_num is 0).
      The message header for fake SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 client hellos created from     SSL 2.0 client hellos added with the previous commit was totally wrong --     it must start with the message type, not the protocol version.     (Not that this particular header is actually used anywhere ...)
      Add per-SSL 'msg_callback' with 'msg_callback_arg'.     Both have per-SSL_CTX defaults.     These new values can be set by calling SSL[_CTX]_[callback_]ctrl     with codes SSL_CTRL_SET_MSG_CALLBACK and SSL_CTRL_SET_MSG_CALLBACK_ARG.
      document SSL_OP_NO_SESSION_RESUMPTION_ON_RENEGOTIATION
      gcc complained about &quot;write&quot; being shadowed even though the &quot;write&quot;     variable name occured just in a function *prototype* -- so rename it
      New functions SSL[_CTX]_set_msg_callback().     New macros SSL[_CTX]_set_msg_callback_arg().
      Call msg_callback with correct length parameter if ssl3_write_bytes had to     be called multiple times
      Fix memory leak.
      Fix SSL handshake functions and SSL_clear() such that SSL_clear()     never resets s-&gt;method to s-&gt;ctx-&gt;method when called from within     one of the SSL handshake functions.
      Assume TLS 1.0 when ClientHello fragment is too short.
      Consistency with s2_... and s23_... variants (no real functional     change)
      filenames are des_old.[ch], not des.comp*
      Add '-noemailDN' option to 'openssl ca'.  This prevents inclusion of     the e-mail address in the DN (i.e., it will go into a certificate     extension only).  The new configuration file option 'email_in_dn = no'     has the same effect.
      mention des_old.h
      remove redundant definitions that are also in des.h
      Like MD_Init, MD now must include a NULL engine pointer in its definition.
      disable caching in BIO_gethostbyname
      Consistency fix in BUF_MEM_grow: Initialise to zero when new memory     had to be allocated, not just when reusing the existing buffer.
      Note BUF_MEM_grow() consistency fix.
      Don't define _REENTRANT here in e_os.h.  On systems where we need     _REENTRANT if threads support is enabled, the ./Configure entry must     define it so that it ends up in CFLAG.

      the PRNG race conditions were mostly a theoretical issue, remove from NEWS

      Bugfix: In ssl3_accept, don't use a local variable 'got_new_session'     to indicate that a real handshake is taking place (the value will be     lost during multiple invocations). Set s-&gt;new_session to 2 instead.

      - update from current 0.9.6-stable CHANGES file     - update from current 0.9.7-stable CHANGES file:
      BIS correction/addition
      improve wording
      Change ./Configure so that certain algorithms can be disabled by default.     This is now the case for RC5.
      In addition to RC5, also exclude MDC2 from compilation unless     the algorithm is explicitly requested.
      Take MDC2 patent into account.
      Fix typo
      fix potential memory leak when allocation fails
      It seems that Configure revision 1.404 broke &quot;make depend&quot; by hiding     from it which algorithms were disabled.  With these new changes,     &quot;make depend&quot; will properly take into account algorithms that are skipped.
      &quot;make depend&quot;.  This takes into account the algorithms that are now     disabled by default (MDC2 and RC5), which until now were skipped     by &quot;make links&quot; and yet supposedly required by some of the Makefiles,     meaning that the recent snapshots failed to compile.

      include max. codes in debug output
      Detect SSL error code mishandling.
      Detect more errors.     Change assignment strategy: rathern than using max+r for new codes,     find first hole in list of existing codes.

      Fix another new bug in the cipherstring logic.

      Error messages for client ECC cert verification.
      another thread-safety fix
      Change array representation of binary polynomials to make GF2m part of     the BN library more generally useful.
      Remove ECC ciphersuites from 0.9.8 branch (should use 0.9.9 branch)
      Change in 0.9.8 branch:     Put ECCdraft ciphersuites back into default build (but disabled     unless specifically requested)
      New functions CRYPTO_set_idptr_callback(),     CRYPTO_get_idptr_callback(), CRYPTO_thread_idptr() for a 'void *' type     thread ID, since the 'unsigned long' type of the existing thread ID     does not always work well.
      always read in RAND_poll() if we can't use select because of a too     large FD: it's non-blocking mode anyway
      use &lt;poll.h&gt; as by Single Unix Specification

      Remove non-functional part of recent patch, after discussion with     Colin Percival (this would have caused more problems than solved,     and isn't really necessary anyway)
      update information on &quot;current version&quot; ...
      Make sure the int_rsa_verify() prototype matches the implementation     (m_len currently is 'unsigned int', not 'size_t')
      ensure that ciphersuite strings such as &quot;RC4-MD5&quot; match the SSL 2.0     ciphersuite as well
      Update
      Ensure that the addition mods[i]+delta cannot overflow in probable_prime().
      include 0.9.8d and 0.9.7l information
      Introduce limits to prevent malicious keys being able to     cause a denial of service.  (CVE-2006-2940)     [Steve Henson, Bodo Moeller]
      All 0.9.8d patches have been applied to HEAD now, so we no longer need     the redundant entries under the 0.9.9 heading.
      ASN1_item_verify needs to initialize ctx before any &quot;goto err&quot; can     happen; the new code for the OID cross reference table failed to do so.
      fix support for receiving fragmented handshake messages
      Fix the BIT STRING encoding of EC points or parameter seeds     (need to prevent the removal of trailing zero bits).
      Reorganize the data used for SSL ciphersuite pattern matching.     This change resolves a number of problems and obviates multiple kludges.     A new feature is that you can now say &quot;AES256&quot; or &quot;AES128&quot; (not just     &quot;AES&quot;, which enables both).
      fix incorrect strength bit values for certain Kerberos ciphersuites
      fix warnings/inconsistencies caused by the recent changes to the     ciphersuite selection code in HEAD
      fix warnings for CIPHER_DEBUG builds
      Include &quot;!eNULL&quot; in SSL_DEFAULT_CIPHER_LIST to make sure that a     ciphersuite string such as &quot;DEFAULT:RSA&quot; cannot enable     authentication-only ciphersuites.
      fix a typo in the new ciphersuite ordering code
      Improve ciphersuite order stability when disabling ciphersuites.     Change ssl_create_cipher_list() to prefer ephemeral ECDH over     ephemeral DH.
      SSL_kKRB5 ciphersuites shouldn't be preferred by default
      delete obsolete comment
      prefer SHA1 over MD5 (this affects the Kerberos ciphersuites)

      Clean up error codes a bit.     (engines/ccgost/ remains utter chaos, though; &quot;make errors&quot; is not happy.)
      fix warning
      Implement the Opaque PRF Input TLS extension     (draft-rescorla-tls-opaque-prf-input-00.txt), and do some cleanups and     bugfixes on the way.  In particular, this fixes the buffer bounds     checks in ssl_add_clienthello_tlsext() and in ssl_add_serverhello_tlsext().
      fix length parameter in SSL_set_tlsext_opaque_prf_input() calls
      properly handle length-zero opaque PRF input values     (which are pointless, but still might occur)
      The hash length check wasn't strict enough,     as pointed out by Ernst G Giessmann
      fix typos

      Add extended key usage OID and update STATUS file.
      Move DSA test in ca.c inside #ifdef and make pubkey BIT STRING always have     zero unused bits.
      Make sure applications free up pkey structures and add netscape extension     handling to x509.c
      Remove one EVP_PKEY_free() that shouldn't be there.
      More EVP_PKEY patches for new functionality.
      Fix things so DH_free() will be no-op when passed NULL, like RSA_free() and     DSA_free(): this was causing crashes when for example an attempt was made     to handle a (currently) unsupported DH public key. Also X509_PUBKEY_set()i     wasn't checking errors from d2i_PublicKey().
      Oops! update CHANGES file properly.
      Fix the gendsa program and add it to the app list. The progs.h file is     auto generated but not auto updated so it is included. Also remove the     encryption from the sample DSA keys.
      Fix OBJ_txt2nid(): old function was broken when input used the &quot;dot&quot; form, e.g.     1.2.3.4 . Also added new function OBJ_txt2obj().

      Fix parameters to dummy function BN_ref_mod_exp().
      Time to blow up the source tree :-) This is the beginning of support for     GeneralizedTime. At several points PKIX specifies that GeneralizedTime can be     used but OpenSSL doesn't currently support it. This patch adds several files     and a bunch of functions.
      Update CHANGES for GeneralizedTime info.
      New err_code.pl script to retain old error codes. This should allow the use     of 'make errors' without causing huge re-organisations of files when a new     code is added.
      This is the result of a &quot;make errors&quot; with the new error building functionality     in place.
      Continued patches so certificates and CRLs now can support and use     GeneralizedTime.
      Initial addition of new X509 V3 files, tidy of old files.
      Continuing adding X509 V3 support. This starts to integrate the code with     the main library, but only with printing at present. To see this try:     openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text     on a certificate with some extensions in it.
      Add file x509v3.err.
      More X509 V3 stuff. Add support for extensions in the 'req' application     so that: openssl req -x509 -new -out cert.pem     will take extensions from openssl.cnf a sample for a CA is included.     Also change the directory order so pem is nearer the end. Otherwise 'make links'     wont work because pem.h can't be built.
      Still more X509 V3 stuff. Modify ca.c to work with the new code and modify     openssl.cnf for the new syntax.
      Add a few extended key usage OIDs.
      Add ASN1 code for netscape certificate sequences.
      Remember to add the new file this time :-)
      Allow the -certfile argument to be used multiple times in crl2pkcs7.     Also fix typos in the usage messages: &quot;inout&quot; instead of &quot;input&quot;.
      New program 'nseq' added to apps to allow Netscape certificate sequences to     be pulled apart and built.
      Update STATUS, modify ssl.h so mkdef.pl will pick up prototypes and     add x509v3.h to mkdef.pl list of include files.
      Fix various stuff: that VC++ 5.0 chokes on:     1. Add *lots* of missing prototypes for static ssl functions.     2. VC++ doesn't understand the 'LL' suffix for 64 bits constants: change bn.org     3. Add a few missing prototypes in pem.org     Fix mk1mf.pl so it outputs a Makefile that doesn't choke Win95.     Fix mkdef.pl so it doesn't truncate longer names.
      More Win32 fixes. The Configure script used to give *lots* of warnings about     use of undefined variables: kludge so they all get initialised. Also avoid use     of POSIX module.
      Delete bogus V3 prototype and update the *.num files to include ordinals for     the new functions. Update MINFO.
      Oops! Restore ssleay.num: it got overwritten with libeay.num :-(
      Rename v3_bitstr.c to v3_bitst.c to fit in 8+3. Rebuild MINFO to reflect     change.
      Delete legacy file.
      Add support for GeneralName and GeneralNames extensions. Also preliminary     support for subject and issuer alt name. Add a new ASN1 macro and fix a     nasty bug that left an ASN1 buffer modified on an error condition with     IMPLICIT tagging.
      Fix filename in comment.
      Comment out def of currently unimplemented function to stop warning.
      Support for ASN1 ENUMERATED type. This copies and duplicates the ASN1_INTEGER     code and adds support to ASN1_TYPE and asn1parse.
      Oops... forgot to add new ENUMERATED file...
      More extension code. Incomplete support for subject and issuer alt     name, issuer and authority key id. Change the i2v function parameters     and add an extra 'crl' parameter in the X509V3_CTX structure: guess     what that's for :-) Fix to ASN1 macro which messed up     IMPLICIT tag and add f_enum.c which adds a2i, i2a for ENUMERATED.
      Oops. Forgot to do a 'make errors'.
      Delete a few unused files in apps, restore CAST WIN32 ASM file to main     tree.
      Make the 'crypto' and 'ssl' options in the perl script mkdef.pl really work,     also add an 'update' option to automatically append any new functions to the     ssleay.num and libeay.num files.
      Fix typo in asn1.h (PRINTABLESTRING_STRING) and fix a bug in object creation     perl script. It failed if the OID had any zeros in it.
      Modify configure script to generate some files that Win32 needs and new     script that does the same as 'make files'.
      Oops... add other changes this time too.
      More Win32 fixes and upsdate INSTALL.W32 documentation.
      Convert ms/do_ms.bat to DOS EOL format of DOS chokes on it.
      Add support for raw extensions. This means that you can include the DER encoding     of an arbitrary extension: e.g. 1.3.4.5=critical,RAW:12:34:56 Using this     technique currently unsupported extensions can be generated if you know their     DER encoding. Even if the extension is supported in future the raw extension     will still work: that is the raw version can always be used even if it is a     supported extension.
      Update error codes.
      Patch to Configure script. For some reason the BN_ASM part was truncated to     the first word which broke (at least) the Linux compile. Hopefully this wont     break other platforms.
      Fix various memory leaks in SSL, apps and DSA
      Added code to GENERAL_NAME with support for more options and preliminary     support for assignment in config files.
      Fuller authority key id support, partial support for private key usage extension     and really fix the ASN.1 IMPLICIT bug this time :-)
      Oops! Remeber to include the other patches this time...
      Overhaul 'crl' application, add a proper X509_CRL_print function and start     to support CRL extensions.
      Patch so the new crl stuff actually compiles this time :-) Also update the     Win32 ordinals.
      Preliminary support for reason code CRL extension.
      Add more functionality to issuer alt name and subject alt name. New options     to include email addresses from DN and copy details from issuer certificate.     Include examples in openssl.cnf, update Win32 ordinals.
      Make RSA_NO_PADDING really use no padding.
      Add preliminary user level config documentation for extension stuff. Programming     info will come later...
      Various changes to make this stuff compile under Win32 and VC++ with and     without -debug option to mk1mf.pl. Change _export to is_export (_export is     a reserved word under VC++). Add yucky function prototype function pointer     casts. Sanitise the included files in crypto/x509v3.
      Redo the way 'req' and 'ca' add objects: add support for oid_section.
      Remove debugging fprintf from req.c and fix the code so it properly skips over     the first leading XXX. in the DN.
      BN_RECURSION causes the stuff in bn_mont.c to fall over for large keys. For     now change it to BN_RECURSION_MONT so it isn't compiled in.
      Fix the Win32 compile environment and add various changes so it will now compile     under Win32 (9X and NT) again. Note: some signed/unsigned changes recently     checked in were killing the Win32 compile.
      Deleted my str_dup() function from X509V3: the same functionality is provided     by BUF_MEM_strdup(). Added text documentation to the BUF_MEM stuff.
      Workaround for a Win95 console bug triggered by the password read stuff.
      Fix the PKCS#7 stuff: signature verify could fail if attributes reordered, the     detached data encoding was wrong and free up public keys.
      Add an extra 'raw' function r2i to the extension code. Nothing uses this yet and     it is just a place holder for functionality to be added later. Its been added     now so the X509V3_EXT_METHOD structure shouldn't (hopefully) have to change     after the release.
      Added support for adding extensions to CRLs, also fix a memory leak and     make 'req' check the config file syntax before it adds extensions. Added     info in the documentation as well.
      Delete obsolete old X509V3 files.
      Various fixes to Win32, update ssleay.num, libeay.num, shuffle various #ifdefs     around so more options appear in e_os.h
      Add missing funtions from non ANSI section of header files and add missing     ordinals to libeay.num.
      Comment out two unimplemented functions from bio.h. Attempt to get the     Win32 test batch file going again.
      Remove some hard coded paths from Win32 test stuff.
      Make CC,CFLAG etc get passed to make links and various Win32 fixes.
      Fix couple of ANSI declarations and prototypes
      Fix for RSA private key encryption if p &lt; q. This took ***ages*** to track down.
      Delete NULL ciphers from 'ALL' in the cipher list aliases. This means that     NULL ciphers specifically have to be enabled with e.g. &quot;DEFAULT:eNULL&quot;. This     prevents cipher lists from inadvertantly having NULL ciphers at the top     of their list (e.g. the default ones) because they didn't have to be taken     into account before.
      Delete Win32 test with testreq.pem and req: there is already a test with     testreq2.pem.
      Remove some references which called malloc and free instead of Malloc and Free.
      Using int for the digest length in EVP_DigestFinal() broke some compilers.     Changed to unsigned int: also need an evil cast in pk7_doit.c because a     signed, unsigned comparison chokes VC++.
      Comment out the lines that generated by mk1mf.pl include three separate rules     that are equivalent to $(OUT_D). This was what was causing the 'too many rules'     warning under VC++.
      Add initial support for Thawte strong extranet certificate extensions and     include an 'indent' option to V3 stuff.
      extranet file added...
      This is the beginning of PKCS#12 integration. This just adds the PKCS#12     objects to objects.h
      Further PKCS#12 integration, PBE, PKCS#8 additions.
      Yet more PKCS#12 integration: add lots of files under crypto/pkcs12 and add     them to the build environment.
      Various PKCS#12 related tidies and fixes: it might even compile now :-)
      Include pkcs12 program as part of openssl. This completes most of the PKCS#12     integration.
      Remove deleted PKCS#12 functions from pkcs12.h, get rid of object creation     kludge, remove CRs from ssl_ciph.c and update Win32 functions for PKCS#12     code. It might compile under Win32 now ...
      Delete some auto generated files and correct a typo in crypto/asn1/p5_pbe.c
      Did a 'make errors' to update asn1 error codes now typo is fixed
      Add PKCS#5 v2.0 ASN1 structures.
      Delete all the old X509V3 pack and unpack stuff and various structures and     files associated with them. This stuff is all obsoleted by the new X509V3 code.
      Add some utilities to support SXNet extension also add support in DEF files     generator to typesafe stacks.
      Fix a horrible BN bug in bn_expand2 which caused BN_add_word() et al to fail     when they cause the destination to expand.
      Add initial support for r2i RAW extensions which can access the config database     add various X509V3_CTX helper functions and support for LHASH as the config     database.
      Add support for VISIBLESTRING and UTF8String
      Allow asn1parse to print out VISIBLESTRING and some code needed for certificate     policies extension.
      Initial support for Certificate Policies extension: print out works but setting     isn't fully implemented (yet).
      Finish off support for Certificate Policies extension.
      Various fixes so Win32 compile may work. Convert GeneralNames to use safe stack.
      Suppport for CRL distribution points extension. Also document some of     this stuff.
      Oops! Fixup CHANGES.
      Complete rewrite of the error code generation script. It now runs as a single     script, translates function codes better and doesn't need the K&amp;R function     prototypes to work (NB. the K&amp;R prototypes can't be wiped just yet: they are     still needed by the DEF generator...). I also ran the script with the -rewrite     option to update all the header and source files.
      Delete the unnecessary ERR and ERRC lines in makefiles, add some functionality     to error code script: it can now find untranslatable function codes (usually     because the function is static and not defined in a header: occasionally because     of a typo...) and unreferenced function and reason codes. To see this try:     perl util/mkerr.pl -recurse -debug     Also fixed some typos in crypto/pkcs12 that this found :-)     Also tidy up some error calls that had to be all on one line: the old error     script couldn't find codes unless the call was all on one line.
      Change the command line options of mkerr.pl so -static is now default and     a -write option is needed to actually change anything. Second attempt at     getting rid of ERR, ERRC definitions: it might even work this time :-)
      Fix mkerr.pl to find functions returning function pointers (thanks Ulf!)     also add a few missing prototypes.
      Various header consistency fixes.
      Fixes so it will compile again under Win32.
      Extensively changed the DEF file generator mkdef.pl to use a modified version     of Ulf's prototype parser, also general tidying and fixing of several problems     with the original. Its still a bit of a hack but should work.
      Add PKCS#12 documentation and new option in x509 to add certificate extensions.
      Oops ... fix warning.
      Fix a couple of cases where an attempt is made to lock an already locked     mutex.
      GeneralizedTime setting fixes.
      Allows PKCS#12 password to be placed on command line and add allow config     file name for 'ca' to come from the environment.
      Various Win32 fixes. Win95 doesn't support MoveFileEx() (which was used for a     Win32 version of rename() ). There isn't a precise rename() equivalent under     Win95: the standard rename() complains if the destination already exists so     replaced with a combination of unlink() and MoveFile().
      Kill evil casts, fix PKCS#7 and add new X509V3 Function.
      Various PKCS#7 fixes to properly (maybe!) handle PKCS#7 enveloped data.     Containts elements of code by Sebastian Akerman &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">sak at parallelconsulting.com</A>&gt;     and made a bit less &quot;naughty&quot; by Steve.
      Various PKCS#7 related fixes,tidies and comments.
      Add new -out option to asn1parse to allow the parsed data to be output.     Fixed -strparse option: it didn't work if used more than once (this was due     to the d2i_ASN1_TYPE call parsing a freed buffer). On Win32 the file wincrypt.h     #define's X509_NAME and PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO causing clashes so these are #undef'ed
      Several of the EVP_CIPHER structures had the get and set asn1 parameter     functions transposed.
      The encoding of negative ASN1 INTEGERs and the conversion of BNs to negative     integers was completely broken. Also added a NEG_PUBKEY_BUG compilation option     to compensate for public keys improperly encoded as negative integers.
      Various Win32 fixes. Change args in do_ms.bat to put platform last. Fix     unsigned/signed cmp error in asn1parse. Change various pem_all.c args to     use pem_password_cb.
      Fix some obvious bugs in the PKCS#7 library handling. It didn't try to     find the right RecipientInfo based on the recipient certificate (so would     fail a lot of the time) and fixup cipher structures to correctly (maybe)     modify the AlgorithmIdentifiers.  Largely untested at present... this will be     fixed in due course. Well the stuff was broken to begin with so if its broken     now then you haven't lost anything :-)
      Fix various less obvious bugs in PKCS#7 handling: such as not zeroing     the secret key before we've encrypted it and using the right NID for RC2-64.     Add various arguments to the experimental programs 'dec' and 'enc' to make     testing less painful.
      Oops! Get the pmatch test the right way round.
      Various clarifications to extension docs: change the name of literal     extensions from RAW to DER to avoid confusion with raw extensions.
      Change default PKCS#12 iteration count to 2048, include rsa_oeap_test in the     test batch file.
      New functions sk_set, sk_value and sk_num to replace existing macros: this is     to minimise the effects on existing code.
      Include some notes on basic extension usage and change openssl.cnf to usually     do sensible things with extensions.
      The last argument in the d2i_XXX_fp and  d2i_XXX_bio functions should be     of type XXX ** not XXX *
      Move the Win32 #undefs of X509_NAME and PKCS7_ISSUER_AND_SERIAL so they will     always get included with the relevant files.
      Fixup do_nt.bat for new mk1mf arg order.
      Set ext_list to NULL after use.
      Fix URL for perl in INSTALL.W32
      Update md5 assembly source for Win32.
      Fix for memory leak.
      Free up 'out' before exiting pkcs12 application.     Submitted by: Wu Zhigang &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">zhigangwu at yahoo.com</A>&gt;
      Add PKCS#5 v1.5 compatible algorithms and initial PKCS#8 support. PKCS#8 needs     more work: need an application and make the private key routines automatically     handle PKCS#8.
      The rest of the PKCS#5, PKCS#8 patch I forgot before :-)
      Add a 'pkcs8' application for initial PKCS#8 support. Still needs lots more     options to handle encrypted and unencrypted forms and DER format input and     output.
      Add d2i,i2d bio and fp functions for PKCS#8 and add -inform and -outform     arguments to pkcs8 application.
      More PKCS#8 stuff. Support for unencrypted forms of private key.
      Change so PEM private key read routines can handle PKCS#8 transparently.
      Rewrite PBE handling read to support PKCS#5 v2.0 and update the function     list for Win32.
      Change PBE handling a bit more: now the key and iv generator does calls     EVP_CipherInit() this because the IV wont be easily available when doing     PKCS#5 v2.0
      More PKCS#5 v2.0 development. Add a function to setup a PKCS#5 v2.0     AlgorithmIdentifier and make various ASN1 fixes.
      This is the main PKCS#5 v2.0 key generation function, it parses the ASN1     structure and decides what key to generate (if any). Not currently added to     the PBE algorithm list because it is largely untested.
      Complete support for PKCS#5 v2.0. Still needs extensive testing.
      Change the PEM function implementation to use a common set of macros: this     should make modifying them easier.
      Reformat and &quot;modernise&quot; the sign.c demo.
      Two new functions to write out PKCS#8 private keys. Also fixes for some of     the the PBE code and a new constant PKCS5_DEFAULT_ITER for the default     iteration count if it is passed as zero.
      Document the X509V3 code and change some of the extension function pointers     to use 'void *' rather than 'char *' for an &quot;arbitrary extension&quot;.
      Fix to i2d_DSAPublicKey() to return the correct length.     Submitted by: Jeon KyoungHo &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">khjeon at sds.samsung.co.kr</A>&gt;
      New functions CONF_load_bio() and CONF_load_fp() to load a configuration     file from a bio or fp. Added some more constification to the BN library.
      Convert the CONF library to use a typesafe stack: a STACK_OF(CONF_VALUE). It     seemed like a good idea at the time... several hours later it was rather     obvious that these are used all over the place making the changes rather     extensive.
      Implement STACK_OF(ANS1_OBJECT) for extended key usage extension, change the     documentation to reflect the STACK_OF(CONF_VALUE) change to the CONF lib and     use ANSI typedefs for X509V3_EXT_I2D and X509V3_EXT_FREE.
      Change the PEM_* function prototypes to use DECLARE_PEM macros and change     util/mkdef.pl to handle this. Also do a 'make update'.
      New function PKCS7_signatureVerify to allow the signing certificate to     be explicitly stated with PKCS#7 verify.
      Fix d2i_ASN1_INTEGER() and i2d_ASN1_INTEGER() so it correctly works out     the length of negative integers.
      New functions to allow RSA_METHODs to be changed without poking round in     RSA structure internals.
      SXnet code was freeing up the extension data rather than the temporary     zone number.
      Fix a bug in x509.c that omitted DSA parameters when they didn't match the     signers parameters. Changed it to never omit parameters.
      Copy flags in ASN1_STRING_dup()
      Add a debugging option to PKCS#5 v2.0 key generation function.
      Various changes to stop VC++ choking under Win32.
      Beginnings of experimental support for NASM assembler. This is a free     assembler for various X86 platforms including Win32. It can output object files     that VC++ will tolerate so it could be used to provide assembly language support     to Win32 without the need for MASM.
      More NASM support code it still doesn't work but it doesn't work less than it     didn't work before :-)
      Continues NASM support. This might work now. Its still experimental but it     passes all the tests. Added documentation in INSTALL.W32.
      Eliminate a warning: BN_mod_inverse() returns a (BIGNUM *) and remove and     unnecessary cast.
      New RSA flag RSA_FLAG_EXT_PKEY, to always call rsa_mod_exp.
      New function OBJ_obj2txt()
      Tidy up pkcs12 application.
      Allow the PKCS#7 (S/MIME encrypt) application to support more than one     recipient.
      Fix to PKCS#12 code to use the cipher block length when allocating a buffer     for encrypted data, rather than hard coding '8'.
      Configure fix for Windows: under Windows+perl &quot;system&quot; ends up going via the     command shell which means that redirecttion needs backslashes in the paths.
      Change all the -'s to _'s.
      Fix -startdate and -enddate arguments to 'ca' program. Also update NEWS file     with some 0.9.4 changes.
      *** empty log message ***
      Support for parsing of certificate extensions in PKCS#10 requests: these are     used by things like Xenroll. Also include documentation for extendedKeyUsage     extension.
      Add functions to allow extensions to be added to certificate requests.
      Fix PKCS7_ENC_CONTENT_new() to include a sensible default content type and add     support for encrypted content type in PKCS7_set_content().
      Allow memory bios to be read only and change PKCS#7 routines to use them.
      Initial support for DSA_METHOD...
      Initial support for DH_METHOD. Also added a DH lock. A few changes made to     DSA_METHOD to make it more consistent with RSA_METHOD.
      Fix for a bug which meant encrypting BIOs sometimes wouldn't read the final     block.
      Allow extensions to be added to certificate requests, update the sample     config file (change RAW to DER).
      Allow the 1.OU=&quot;my OU&quot; syntax in 'ca' for SPKACs.
      Allow the extension section specified in config files to be overridden     on the command line for various utilities.
      Make DH_free() free up any ex_data and also call the finish method.
      Add new 'spkac' utility and several SPKAC utility functions.
      New UTF8 utility functions to parse/generate UTF8 strings.
      New function to convert ASN1 tag values to strings. Also fix typo in asn1.h
      This is preliminary support for an &quot;RSA null&quot; cipher. Unfortunately when     OpenSSL is compiled with NO_RSA, no RSA operations can be used: including     key generation storage and display of RSA keys. Since these operations are     not covered by the RSA patent (my understanding is it only covers encrypt,     decrypt, sign and verify) they can be included: this is an often requested     feature, attempts to use the patented operations return an error code.
      Oops... forgot the other RSA_NULL patches...
      Fix typo.
      Fix typo.
      Various CRL enhancements tidies and workaround for broken CRLs.
      Add new sign and verify members to RSA_METHOD and change SSL code to use sign     and verify rather than direct encrypt/decrypt.
      Lots of evil casts to stop VC++ choking with &quot;possible loss of data&quot;     warnings :-(
      Fix to make s_client and s_server work under Windows. A bit of a hack but     an improvement on not working at all.
      Modify the 'speed' application so it now uses RSA_sign and RSA_verify     instead of RSA_private_encrypt and RSA_public_decrypt
      Fix for base64 BIO decoding bug
      Fix for d2i_ASN1_bytes and stop PKCS#7 routines crashing is signed message     contains no certificates.
      Add support for public key input and output in rsa and dsa utilities with some     new DSA public key functions that were missing.
      New option -dhparam to s_server to allow the DH parameter file to be set     explicitly. Previously it couldn't be changed because it was hard coded as     &quot;server.pem&quot;.
      Fix for bug in pkcs12 program and typo in ASN1_tag2str().
      Fix for bug in pkcs12 program and typo in ASN1_tag2str().
      Fix incorrect usage messages in some commands.
      New functions to parse and get extensions.
      Add EX_DATA support to X509.     Fix a bug in the X509_get_d2i() functions which didn't check if crit was NULL.
      Initial support for certificate purpose checking: this will     ultimately lead to certificate chain verification. It is     VERY EXPERIMENTAL at present though.
      Replace the macros in asn1.h with function equivalents. Also make UTF8Strings     tolerated in certificates.
      New function ASN1_mbstring_copy() to handle ASN1 string copying. Ultimately     this will be used to clear up the horrible DN mess.
      More multibyte character support.
      Continued multibyte character support.
      Fix to PKCS#7 routines so it can decrypt some oddball RC2 handling.
      Allow additional information to be attached to a     certificate: currently this includes trust settings     and a &quot;friendly name&quot;.
      Fix to the -revoke option in ca. It was leaking memory, crashing and just     plain not working :-(
      Very preliminary POD format documentation for some     of the openssl utility commands...
      Oops. The pkcs8 man page wasn't finished: this is an updated version
      Fix a couple of outstanding issues: update STATUS file, fix NO_FP_API problems.
      Add password command line options to some utils. Fix and update man     pages.
      More docs and corrections/updates
      Oops forgot the S/MIME v3 RFC.
      Merge some common functionality in the apps, delete     the encryption option in the pkcs7 utility (they never     did anything) and add a couple more options to pkcs7.
      Add an spkac manual page and fix the pkcs7 manpage.

      Add support for magic cipher suite value (MCSV). Make secure renegotiation     work in SSLv3: initial handshake has no extensions but includes MCSV, if     server indicates RI support then renegotiation handshakes include RI.
      Add ctrl and macro so we can determine if peer support secure renegotiation.

      The fix for PR#1949 unfortunately broke cases where the BIO_CTRL_WPENDING     ctrl is incorrectly implemented (e.g. some versions of Apache). As a workaround     call both BIO_CTRL_INFO and BIO_CTRL_WPENDING if it returns zero. This should     both address the original bug and retain compatibility with the old behaviour.

      Add support for certificate stores in CERT structure. This makes it     possible to have different stores per SSL structure or one store in     the parent SSL_CTX. Include distint stores for certificate chain     verification and chain building. New ctrl SSL_CTRL_BUILD_CERT_CHAIN     to build and store a certificate chain in CERT structure: returing     an error if the chain cannot be built: this will allow applications     to test if a chain is correctly configured.

      Abort handshake if signature algorithm used not supported by peer.
      Make tls1_check_chain return a set of flags indicating checks passed     by a certificate chain. Add additional tests to handle client     certificates: checks for matching certificate type and issuer name     comparison.
      add suite B chain validation flags and associated verify errors
      Rename Suite B functions for consistency.
      update ordinals
      Add three Suite B modes to TLS code, supporting RFC6460.

      update debug-steve* configurations
      New compile time option OPENSSL_SSL_TRACE_CRYPTO, when set this passes     all derived keys to the message callback.
      oops, typo
      Add compilation flag to disable certain protocol checks and allow use of     some invalid operations for testing purposes. Currently this can be used     to sign using digests the peer doesn't support, EC curves the peer     doesn't support and use certificates which don't match the type associated     with a ciphersuite.
      give more meaningful error if presented with wrong certificate type by server

      fix memory leak
      Minor enhancement to PR#2836 fix. Instead of modifying SSL_get_certificate     change the current certificate (in s-&gt;cert-&gt;key) to the one used and then     SSL_get_certificate and SSL_get_privatekey will automatically work.
      fix memory leak
      enhance EC method to support setting curve type when generating keys and add parameter encoding option
      Add ctrl and utility functions to retrieve raw cipher list sent by client in     client hello message. Previously this could only be retrieved on an initial     connection and it was impossible to determine the cipher IDs of any uknown     ciphersuites.
      Add -brief option to s_client and s_server to summarise connection details.
      Add -rev test option to s_server to just reverse order of characters received     by client and send back to server. Also prints an abbreviated summary of     the connection parameters.
      If OPENSSL_SSL_DEBUG_BROKEN_PROTOCOL is set allow the use of &quot;SCSV&quot; as     a ciphersuite to position the SCSV value in different places for testing     purposes.
      New functions to check a hostname email or IP address against a     certificate. Add options to s_client, s_server and x509 utilities     to print results of checks.

      Gets around VC++ compiler pickiness. (long != double)

      This is a set of startup code for the DSO support, it's not yet linked into     the build process (an upcoming commit no doubt), and is very much *new*     code - what that means is that it compiles ok - usually. It certainly     doesn't mean it runs well or even properly yet. Please don't muck round     with this unless you're looking to help out and hunt bugs. :-)
      This commit ties the new DSO code (crypto/dso/) into the build for a     variety of platforms. A few are missing, and they will be added in     eventually, but as this is new stuff, it was better to not break lots of     platforms in one go that we can't easily test. The changes to &quot;Configure&quot;     should illustrate how to add support to other systems if you feel like     having a go.
      Better make a note of what's going on ... :-)
      This helps make the DSO stuff more portable;     * &quot;no-dso&quot; option available in Configure so that all DSO methods will       return NULL, overriding any support the platform might otherwise       have built.     * dlfcn_no_h config string now available rather than just dlfcn. This       is for platforms that have dlfcn.h functions but do not have (or       need) the dlfcn.h header file.
      I forgot about $openssl_other_defines ... should probably do this     for consistency. Not sure though whether HAVE_DLFCN_H should be     included too? If we go the autoconf route then this probably wouldn't     be included.
      Constification, and a silly mistake in the comments.
      This change facilitates name translation for shared libraries. The     technique used is far from perfect and alternatives are welcome.     Basically if the translation flag is set, the string is not too     long, and there appears to be no path information in the string,     then it is converted to whatever the standard should be for the     DSO_METHOD in question, eg;         blah --&gt; libblah.so   on *nix, and         blah --&gt; blah.dll     on win32.
      Thanks to &quot;make update&quot; ...
      Previously, the default RSA_METHOD was NULL until the first RSA structure was     initialised, at which point an appropriate default was chosen. This meant a     call to RSA_get_default_method might have returned FALSE.
      The handling of DSA_METHOD and DH_METHOD wasn't quite as problematic as     with RSA_METHOD (the **_get_default_methods do set the default value if     it's not set). However, the code had some duplication and was a bit     conter-intuitive.
      This case in the &quot;dso_unload&quot; handlers should not be reported as an error -     if a DSO_load(NULL,...) operation fails, it will have to call DSO_free() on     the DSO structure it created and that will filter through to this &quot;unload&quot;     call.
      cvs update
      oops.
      This declaration seems to have been added into the header file accidently.     There's no trace of it being implemented and it doesn't seem to have been     intended given that it is prototyped with a BIO yet there was a BIO-     specific version added in at the same time.
      It seems that mktime does what is required here. Certainly timegm() can     not be used because it is not available on all systems (most notably,     win32).
      another warning.
      Minor corrections to documentation.
      &quot;make update&quot;
      All the little functions created by the IMPLEMENT_STACK_OF() macro will     cast their type-specific STACK into a real STACK and call the underlying     sk_*** function. The problem is that if the STACK_OF(..) parameter being     passed in has a &quot;const *&quot; qualifier, it is discarded by the cast.
      sk_value was also suffering from de-const-ification.     Also, add in a couple of missing declarations in pkcs7 code.
      sk_***_new_null() seems to be there to avoid exactly this sort of thing     which is a cast between NULL and a function pointer.
      This is the first of two commits (didn't want to dump them all into the     same one). However, the first will temporarily break things until the     second comes through. :-)
      The previous commit to crypto/stack/*.[ch] pulled the type-safety strings     yet tighter, and also put some heat on the rest of the library by     insisting (correctly) that compare callbacks used in stacks are prototyped     with &quot;const&quot; parameters. This has led to a depth-first explosion of     compiler warnings in the code where 1 constification has led to 3 or 4     more. Fortunately these have all been resolved to completion and the code     seems cleaner as a result - in particular many of the _cmp() functions     should have been prototyped with &quot;const&quot;s, and now are. There was one     little problem however;
      This change will cause builds (by default) to not use different STACK     structures and functions for each stack type. The previous behaviour     can be enabled by configuring with the &quot;-DDEBUG_SAFESTACK&quot; option.     This will also cause &quot;make update&quot; (mkdef.pl in particular) to     update the libeay.num and ssleay.num symbol tables with the number of     extra functions DEBUG_SAFESTACK creates.
      &quot;make update&quot; + stripping the type-specific stack functions out of     libeay.num and ssleay.num.
      Enable DSO support on alpha (OSF1), cc and gcc.
      The atalla functionality doesn't work with the &quot;word&quot; version of     BN_mod_exp. Call the regular atalla mod_exp operation instead.
      Currently the DSO_METHOD interface has one entry point to bind all     &quot;symbols&quot; including functions (of all prototypes( and variables. Whilst     casting any function type to another violates ANSI C (I believe), it is     a necessary evil in shared-library APIs. However, it is quite     conceivable that functions in general and data symbols could very well     be represented differently to each other on some systems, as Bodo said;
      'make update'
      * This adds some checking to the 'dlfcn' DSO_METHOD that at least lets       it cope with OpenBSD which doesn't understand &quot;RTLD_NOW&quot;.     * Added the dso_scheme config string entry for OpenBSD-x86 to give it       DSO support.     * 'make update' that has also absorbed some of Steve's mkstack changes       for the ASN-related macros.
      Steve fixed up some strange errors introduced into dso_win32.c, and I'm     just converting some spaces to tabs from his fix. :-)
      Time to get rid of some rather silly code duplication - some DSO_ctrl()     commands are common to all DSO_METHODs, hence handle them at the top.
      None of the DSO_METHOD's were handling anything except generic messages.     These are now processed inside DSO_ctrl() itself.
      DSO_ctrl() changes have removed a couple of DSO_METHOD-specific functions     so I've regenerated the error numbers and strings for the DSO functions.
      This changes the behaviour of the DSO mechanism for determining an     appropriate filename translation on the host system. Apart from this point,     users should also note that there's a slight change in the API functions     too. The DSO now contains its own to-be-converted filename     (&quot;dso-&gt;filename&quot;), and at the time the DSO loads the &quot;dso-&gt;loaded_filename&quot;     value is set to the translated form. As such, this also provides an impicit     way of determining if the DSO is currently loaded or not. Except, perhaps,     VMS .... :-)
      Add a note about the recent DSO changes in CHANGES.
      DSO_load() should also work when it is passed a NULL - a new DSO is created     automatically, however some code was still referring to the original     pointer rather than the internal one (and thus to NULL instead of the     created pointer).
      This is a demo that performs SSL tunneling (client and/or server) and is     built using an abstracted state machine with a non-blocking IP wrapper     around it. README will follow in the next commit.
      Explanation, tips, etc.
      oops, remove comments that are no longer true.
      Richard moved hw_nuron.c over to DSO-land recently, so this include isn't     needed now.
      Many applications that use OpenSSL with ENGINE support might face a     situation where they've initialised the ENGINE, loaded keys (which are then     linked to that ENGINE), and performed other checks (such as verifying     certificate chains etc). At that point, if the application goes     multi-threaded or multi-process it creates problems for any ENGINE     implementations that are either not thread/process safe or that perform     optimally when they do not have to perform locking and other contention     management tasks at &quot;run-time&quot;.
      I have no idea how this comment got there, but it's certainly not     applicable to ENGINE_ctrl()
      Ensure that the &quot;ex_data&quot; member of an RSA structure is initialised before     the RSA_METHOD's &quot;init()&quot; handler is called, and is cleaned up after the     RSA_METHOD's &quot;finish()&quot; handler is called. Custom RSA_METHODs may wish to     initialise contexts and other specifics in the RSA structure upon creation     and that was previously not possible - &quot;ex_data&quot; is where that stuff     should go and it was being initialised too late for it to be used.
      It was a small change, but it *could* conceivably affect people - so I'm     making a note in the CHANGES file.
      A typo and a couple of logic errors fixed. I think there may still be one     or two kinks lurking around, but it now appears to deal with the basic     test cases ok.
      Minor tweaks and improvements to the tunala demo.
      Make s_client/s_server-style cert verification output configurable by     command line, and make the peer-authentication similarly configurable.
      More little changes to the tunala demo;
      Do to DH and DSA what has already been done to RSA. This involves moving     the initialisation and cleanup of &quot;ex_data&quot; elements to before an init()     handler and after a finish() handler respectively.
      Amend the original CHANGES log entry. The ex_data handling has been     similarly modified now on DH and DSA.
      * Fix a slight bug in the state-machine. This caused the client end of a       tunnel to not pro-actively close down when failing an SSL handshake.
      First step in tidying up the LHASH code. The callback prototypes (and     casts) used in the lhash code are about as horrible and evil as they can     be. For starters, the callback prototypes contain empty parameter lists.     Yuck.
      Next step in tidying up the LHASH code. This commit defines DECLARE and     IMPLEMENT macros for defining wrapper functions for &quot;hash&quot; and &quot;cmp&quot; callbacks     that are specific to the underlying item type in a hash-table. This prevents     function pointer casting altogether, and also provides some type-safety     because the macro does per-variable casting from the (void *) type used in     LHASH itself to the type declared in the macro - and if that doesn't match the     prototype expected by the &quot;hash&quot; or &quot;cmp&quot; function then a compiler error will     result.
      Use the new LHASH macros to declare type-safe wrapper functions that can     be used as the hash/compare callbacks without function pointer casting.
      Make the remaining LHASH macro changes. This should leave no remaining     cases of function pointer casting in lh_new() calls - and leave only the     lh_doall and lh_doall_arg cases to be finished.
      Make a note of the LHASH changes.
      Update the documentation to the current state of the LHASH changes. There     will probably be more when the lh_doall[_arg] callbacks are similarly     tidied up, but this 'pod' should now be current.
      ANSI C doesn't allow trailing semi-colons after a function's closing brace     so these macros probably shouldn't be used like that at all. So, this     change removes the misleading comment and also adds an implicit trailing     semi-colon to the DECLARE macros so they too don't require one.
      Sync up with a minor change in lhash.h
      Next step in tidying up the LHASH code.
      This is an engine contributed by Broadcom - it is meant to support the     BCM5805 and BCM5820 units. So far I've merely taken a skim over the code     and changed a few things from their original contributed source     (de-shadowing variables, removing variables from the header, and     re-constifying some functions to remove warnings). If this gives     compilation problems on any system, please let me know. We will hopefully     know for sure whether this actually functions on a system with the relevant     hardware in a day or two.  :-)
      Make a note of the new engine.
      Some minor changes to the &quot;tunala&quot; demo.
      This adds support to 'tunala' for supplying DH parameters (without which it     will not support EDH cipher suites). The parameters can either be loaded     from a file (via &quot;-dh_file&quot;), generated by the application on start-up     (&quot;-dh_special generate&quot;), or be standard DH parameters (as used in     s_server, etc).
      Re-order the options in tunala and add command switches like s_server for     disabling different SSL/TLS protocol versions.
      Whilst in the process of fixing outstanding function-pointer casts in the     LHASH code, this evil was uncovered. The cast was obscuring the fact that     the function was prototyped to take 2 parameters when in fact it is being     used as a callback that should take only one. Anyway, the function itself     ignores the second parameter (thankfully). A proper cure is on the way but     for now this corrects the inconsistency.
      This adds macros to implement (and/or declare) type-safe wrapper functions     around the callbacks required in the LHASH code for the &quot;doall&quot; functions.
      Get rid of the function pointer casting in the debugging memory code due     to LHASH usage. NB: The callback type used as been suctioned off into     crypto.h as CRYPTO_MEM_LEAK_CB to improve clarity.
      Move all the existing function pointer casts associated with LHASH's two     &quot;doall&quot; functions to using type-safe wrappers. As and where required, this     can be replaced by redeclaring the underlying callbacks to use the     underlying &quot;void&quot;-based prototypes (eg. if performance suffers from an     extra level of function invocation).
      It was correctly pointed out to me that my CHANGES entry was a little thin     on details. :-)
      oops, void functions shouldn't try and return a value. Strangely, gcc     didn't even give a warning for this yet HPUX cc considered it an error.     Reported by Lutz(@openssl.org).
      Update the LHASH man page.
      Insert a missing space to stop pod2man giving stroppy &quot;malformed&quot; warnings.
      This change was a quick experiment that I'd wanted to try that works quite     well (and is a good demonstration of how encapsulating the SSL in a     memory-based state machine can make it easier to apply to different     situations).
      Re-order a couple of static functions and &quot;#if 0&quot; out unused ones - this     gets rid of gcc warnings.
      The callbacks in the NAME_FUNCS structure are not used directly as LHASH     callbacks, and their prototypes were consistent as they were. These casts     need reversing.
      'make update'
      This change allows a callback to be used to override the generation of     SSL/TLS session IDs in a server. According to RFC2246, the session ID is an     arbitrary value chosen by the server. It can be useful to have some control     over this &quot;arbitrary value&quot; so as to choose it in ways that can aid in     things like external session caching and balancing (eg. clustering). The     default session ID generation is to fill the ID with random data.
      This adds command-line support to s_server for controlling the generation     of session IDs. Namely, passing &quot;-id_prefix &lt;text&gt;&quot; will set a     generate_session_id() callback that generates session IDs as random data     with &lt;text&gt; block-copied over the top of the start of the ID. This can be     viewed by watching the session ID s_client's output when it connects.
      Note changes re: session ID generation callbacks, etc.
      If a callback is generating a new session ID for SSLv2, then upon exiting,     the ID will be padded out to 16 bytes if the callback attempted to generate     a shorter one. The problem is that the uniqueness checking function used in     callbacks may mistakenly think a 9-byte ID is unique when in fact its     padded 16-byte version is not. This makes the checking function detect     SSLv2 cases, and ensures the padded form is checked rather than the shorter     one passed by the callback.
      Fix an oversight - when checking a potential session ID for conflicts with     an SSL_CTX's session cache, it is necessary to compare the ssl_version at     the same time (a conflict is defined, courtesy of SSL_SESSION_cmp(), as a     matching id/id_length pair and a matching ssl_version). However, the     SSL_SESSION that will result from the current negotiation does not     necessarily have the same ssl version as the &quot;SSL_METHOD&quot; in use by the     SSL_CTX - part of the work in a handshake is to agree on an ssl version!
      I missed one.
      Don't return an error until the global lock is released.
      Actually there were two error cases that could return without releasing the     lock - stupidly, my last change addressed only one of them.
      ENGINE_load_[private|public]_key had error handling that could return     without releasing a lock. This is the same fix as applied to     OpenSSL-engine-0_9_6-stable, minus the ENGINE_ctrl() change - the HEAD     already had that fixed.
      'make update'
      This moves string constants out of vendor headers and into C files.
      Structural references should never be decremented directly - so leave that     to ENGINE_free(). Also, remove &quot;#if 0&quot; code that has no useful future.

      This change to the &quot;dl&quot;, &quot;dlfcn&quot;, and &quot;win32&quot; DSO_METHODs adds the filename     or symbol name to the error stack in the event a load or bind operation     failed.
      This adds 2 things to the ENGINE code.
      Make notes about ENGINE changes.
      &quot;make update&quot;
      Some fixes to the reference-counting in ENGINE code. First, there were a     few statements equivalent to &quot;ENGINE_add(ENGINE_openssl())&quot; etc. The inner     call to ENGINE_openssl() (as with other functions like it) orphans a     structural reference count. Second, the ENGINE_cleanup() function also     needs to clean up the functional reference counts held internally as the     list of &quot;defaults&quot; (ie. as used when RSA_new() requires an appropriate     ENGINE reference). So ENGINE_clear_defaults() was created and is called     from within ENGINE_cleanup(). Third, some of the existing code was     logically broken in its treatment of reference counts and locking (my     fault), so the necessary bits have been restructured and tidied up.
      For some inexplicable reason, I'd (a) left the debugging irreversibly     turned on, and (b) left a somewhat curious debugging string in the output.
      In RSA, DSA, DH, and RAND - if the &quot;***_new()&quot; function fails because the     ENGINE code does not return a default, set an error.
      Fix a memory leak in 'sk_dup' in the case a realloc() fails. Also, tidy up     a bit of weird code in sk_new.
      openssl speed is quite useful for testing hardware support (among other     things), especially as the RSA keys are fixed. However, DSA only fixes the     DSA parameters and then generates the public and private components on the     fly each time - this commit hard-codes some sampled key values so that this     is no longer the case.
      Currently, RSA code, when using no padding scheme, simply checks that input     does not contain more bytes than the RSA modulus 'n' - it does not check     that the input is strictly *less* than 'n'. Whether this should be the     case or not is open to debate - however, due to security problems with     returning miscalculated CRT results, the 'rsa_mod_exp' implementation in     rsa_eay.c now performs a public-key exponentiation to verify the CRT result     and in the event of an error will instead recalculate and return a non-CRT     (more expensive) mod_exp calculation. As the mod_exp of 'I' is equivalent     to the mod_exp of 'I mod n', and the verify result is automatically between     0 and n-1 inclusive, the verify only matches the input if 'I' was less than     'n', otherwise even a correct CRT calculation is only congruent to 'I' (ie.     they differ by a multiple of 'n'). Rather than rejecting correct     calculations and doing redundant and slower ones instead, this
  changes the     equality check in the verification code to a congruence check.
      Tidy up &quot;cvs update&quot; output a bit.
      - New INSTALL document describing different ways to build &quot;tunala&quot; and       possible problems.     - New file breakage.c handles (so far) missing functions.     - Get rid of some signed/unsigned/const warnings thanks to solaris-cc     - Add autoconf/automake input files, and helper scripts to populate missing       (but auto-generated) files.
      The indexes returned by ***_get_ex_new_index() functions are used when     setting stack (actually, array) values in ex_data. So only increment the     global counters if the underlying CRYPTO_get_ex_new_index() call succeeds.     This change doesn't make &quot;ex_data&quot; right (see the comment at the head of     ex_data.c to know why), but at least makes the source code marginally less     frustrating.

      Give DH, DSA, and RSA functions to &quot;up&quot; their reference counts. Otherwise,     dependant code has to directly increment the &quot;references&quot; value of each     such structure using the corresponding lock. Apart from code duplication,     this provided no &quot;REF_CHECK/REF_PRINT&quot; checking and violated     encapsulation.
      Changes crypto/evp/ and ssl/ code from directly incrementing reference     counts in DH, DSA, and RSA structures. Instead they use the new &quot;***_up()&quot;     functions that handle this.
      Make a note of the &quot;up&quot; functions.
      This changes the &quot;ERR&quot; code to have all access to state (a hash table of     error strings and a hash table storing per-thread error state) go via an     ERR_FNS function table. The first time an ERR operation occurs, the     implementation that will be used (from then on) is set to the internal     &quot;defaults&quot; implementation if it has not already been set. The actual LHASH     tables are only accessed by this implementation.
      Note the &quot;ERR&quot; changes.
      Tidy up some code formatting.
      gcc can't spot that 'derlst' is not used uninitialised, so appease it.
      &quot;make update&quot;
      Make sure &quot;CRYPTO_mem_leaks_fp&quot; doesn't itself create a reportable memory     leak.
      Ensure that failure to create the BIO in 'CRYPTO_mem_leaks_fp' doesn't     leave memory debugging turned off.     [Spotted by G&#195;&#182;tz Babin-Ebell]
      (A version of) gcc had been giving somewhat odd &quot;trigraph&quot; warnings about     this construct, and Ulf provided the following insight as to why;
      Only OPENSSL_free() non-NULL pointers.
      First step in fixing &quot;ex_data&quot; support. Warning: big commit log ...
      Make the necessary changes to work with the recent &quot;ex_data&quot; overhaul.     See the commit log message for that for more information.
      Note the &quot;ex_data&quot; changes.
      Convert &quot;max&quot; to &quot;mx&quot; for variable names (brought to my attention by Steve     Henson). Also, reverse a previous change that used an implicit function     pointer cast rather than an explicit data pointer cast in the STACK cleanup     code.
      Correct a typo.
      Add a new ERR function, &quot;ERR_unload_strings&quot;, to complement the existing     &quot;ERR_load_strings&quot; function.
      Note the &quot;ERR_unload_strings&quot; function.
      This change adds a new ENGINE called &quot;dynamic&quot; that allows new ENGINE     implementations to be loaded from self-contained shared-libraries. It also     provides (in engine.h) definitions and macros to help implement a     self-contained ENGINE. Version control is handled in a way whereby the     loader or loadee can veto the load depending on any objections it has with     each other's declared interface level. The way this is currently     implemented assumes a veto will only take place when one side notices the     other's interface level is too *old*. If the other side is newer, it should     be assumed the newer version knows better whether to veto the load or not.     Version checking (like other &quot;dynamic&quot; settings) can be controlled using     the &quot;dynamic&quot; ENGINE's control commands. Also, the semantics for the     loading allow a shared-library ENGINE implementation to handle differing     interface levels on the fly (eg. loading secondary shared-libraries     depending 
 on the versions required).
      This changes the existing hardware ENGINE implementations to dynamically     declare their own error strings so that they can be more easily compiled as     external shared-libraries if desired. Also, each implementation has been     given canonical &quot;dynamic&quot; support at the base of each file and is only     built if the ENGINE_DYNAMIC_SUPPORT symbol is defined.
      Add a &quot;_up&quot; -&gt; &quot;_up_ref&quot; change to libeay.num that was missing from the     recent changes. Also, do the same change to the DSO_up() function.
      Make the 'dynamic' ENGINE bundle up the loading application/library's     locking callbacks to pass to the loaded library (in addition to the     existing mem, ex_data, and err callbacks). Also change the default     implementation of the &quot;bind_engine&quot; function to apply those callbacks, ie.     the IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC_BIND_FN macro.
      Update the ENGINE README, and stock it up with extra verbeage for good     measure (including info and instructions on &quot;dynamic&quot; ENGINEs).
      &quot;DH_up&quot; had been changed to &quot;DH_up_ref&quot; in libeay.num but the function     declaration and implementation had not. So a recent update recreated the     original definition in libeay.num ... this corrects it and changes the &quot;dh&quot;     code to the &quot;up_ref&quot; variant.
      Change DH_up() -&gt; DH_up_ref()
      Add some missing CHANGES items.
      ENGINE's init() and finish() handler functions are used when the ENGINE is     being enabled or disabled (respectively) for operation. Additionally, each     ENGINE has a constructor function where it can do more 'structural' level     intialisations such as loading error strings, creating &quot;ex_data&quot; indices,     etc. This change introduces a handler function that gives an ENGINE a     corresponding opportunity to cleanup when the ENGINE is being destroyed. It     also adds the &quot;get/set&quot; API functions that control this &quot;destroy&quot; handler     function in an ENGINE.
      This adds &quot;destroy&quot; handlers to the existing ENGINEs that load their own     error strings - the destroy handler functions unload the error strings so     any pending error state referring to them will not attempt to reference     them after the ENGINE has been destroyed.
      ENGINEs can now perform structural cleanup.
      enginetest needs 'memset' defined.
      Put all &quot;common&quot; initialisation in the apps_startup() and apps_shutdown()     macros in apps.h.
      make update
      ENGINE files were renamed, and error strings are now in eng_err.c
      ENGINE uses a very opaque design, so we can predeclare the structure type     in &quot;types.h&quot; so that very few headers will need to include engine.h,     generally only C files using API functions will need it (reducing     the header dependencies quite a lot).
      Reduce the header dependencies on engine.h in apps/.
      Updated dependencies from &quot;make update&quot;
      'evp_test' needs to initialise and cleanup EVP_CIPHER_CTX structures. Also,     fix a typo and add cleanup operations. This also switches on memory leak     checking (which is how the rest was found).
      Add a SHA1 test to evptests.txt - only the MD5 hash algorithm was being     tested previously.
      Fix a typo in the preprocessor logic in eng_list.c that had left RSA, DSA,     and DH all conditional upon OPENSSL_NO_RSA.
      Some of the ENGINE file names were changed for 8.3 filename uniqueness     recently. So comments including file names have been fixed, and copyright     notices brought up to &quot;2001&quot; at the same time.
      &quot;make update&quot;
      Some major restructuring changes to ENGINE, including integrated cipher and     digest support, are on their way. Rather than having gigantic commit log     messages and/or CHANGES entries, this change to the README will serve as an     outline of what it all is and how it all works.
      This change replaces the ENGINE's underlying mechanics with the new     ENGINE_TABLE-based stuff - as described in crypto/engine/README.
      This commits the changes to STACK macros forced by recent ENGINE surgery.
      This commits changes to various parts of libcrypto required by the recent     ENGINE surgery. DH, DSA, RAND, and RSA now use *both* &quot;method&quot; and ENGINE     pointers to manage their hooking with ENGINE. Previously their use of     &quot;method&quot; pointers was replaced by use of ENGINE references. See     crypto/engine/README for details.
      Make necessary tweaks to apps/ files due to recent ENGINE surgery. See     crypto/engine/README for details.
      &quot;make update&quot;.
      indentation.
      This change adds cipher and digest support into ENGINE using the     ENGING_TABLE mechanism. The necessary hooks from crypto/evp/ to use this     will be committed shortly.
      This changes EVP's cipher and digest code to hook via the ENGINE support.     See crypto/engine/README for details.
      This change adds dummy RC4 and SHA1 support to the &quot;openssl&quot; ENGINE for     testing. Because of the recent changes (see crypto/engine/README), the     &quot;openssl&quot; ENGINE is no longer needed nor is it loaded automatically or by     ENGINE_load_builtin_engines(). So a explicit ENGINE_load_openssl() call is     required by applications or a modification to eng_all.c before this ENGINE     will be used. This change will send output to stderr as/when its     implementations are used.
      This change puts the original OpenBSD /dev/crypto support that was in     crypto/evp/ into the corresponding ENGINE. This code is currently untested.
      Fiddling.
      Put the cipher info back into the &quot;openssl engine&quot; command.
      Make update to bring in all the cipher/digest-related ENGINE changes.     NB: It looks like mkdef.pl is causing certain cvs wars by continually     flipping the order of some definitions ...
      &quot;FALLBACK&quot; handling was a hack that was thrown out long ago in the     ENGINE redevelopment. The idea had been that &quot;-1&quot; could be used as a     special &quot;ask me later&quot; 'nid' rather than specifying supported cipher and     digest 'nid's up front. However the idea turned out to be pretty broken.
      ENGINE_register_all_complete() will register all implementations of all     algorithms present in all loaded ENGINEs. The result is that if any of     those ENGINEs successfully initialises, and the ENGINE_TABLE_FLAG_NOINIT     flag isn't set, then they will always be used (and cached as defaults) in     preference to software implementations. Ie. accidental auto-detection of     acceleration hardware :-)
      Make &quot;openssl engine -c&quot; list any supported digests as well as supported     ciphers.
      Make an (overdue) note about the recent ENGINE restructuring. Apart from     a few items however, most of the details are deferred to the     crypto/engine/README file.
      The STACK macros take care of casting to and from the designated item type     of the stack, and the (void *) type used in the underlying sk_***     functions.  However, declaring a STACK_OF(type) where type is a *function*     type implicitly involves casts between function pointers and data pointers.     That's a no-no. This changes the ENGINE_CLEANUP handling to use a regular     data type in the stack.
      The cleanup stack in ENGINE changed slightly, so this &quot;make update&quot; is     needed.
      Missing pointer in the eng_table_register function. Reported by     Martin Szotkowski.
      Make sure the &quot;ENGINE_TABLE&quot; cleanup callbacks have correct prototypes.
      As ENGINE_load_openbsd_dev_crypto() is an API function, it makes sense for     it to be defined on all platforms whether or not it is of any practical     use on them. This also resolves linker problems on &quot;special&quot; platforms,     such as win32.
      EVP_EncryptInit_ex() and EVP_DecryptInit_ex() had been defined in evp.h but     not implemented. (Bug reported by Martin Szotkowski)
      Change some EVP prototypes to use &quot;cipher&quot; rather than &quot;type&quot; as a variable     name. The implementations already use this anyway.
      evp_test.c and evptests.txt both need to be linked in the test/ directory     however for different reasons. This separation should prevent the win32     build from interpreting evptests.txt as source code.
      'flags' should only be set inside DSO_load() if constructing a new DSO     object - otherwise we overwrite any flags that had been previously set in     the DSO before calling DSO_load().
      The &quot;openssl&quot; ENGINE is no longer used except as a testing/debugging     device. This change enables it for building as a self-contained &quot;dynamic&quot;     ENGINE, to help testing such mechanisms.
      When the &quot;dynamic&quot; ENGINE loads another ENGINE from a shared-library, it     essentially overwrites itself with the new ENGINE, with the exception of     reference counts, ex_data structures, and other 'admin' elements. However     if the new ENGINE doesn't populate certain elements, there's the risk of     the &quot;dynamic&quot; ENGINE's elements showing through - the &quot;cmd_defns&quot; were just     one of the possibilities. This implements a more comprehensive cleanup.
      In this particular error condition, the structural reference wasn't being     released.
      Cut &quot;ENGINE_ID&quot; to the more concise &quot;ID&quot;.
      This looks to have been a typo.
      Constify.
      - Add the same header stuff to aes_locl.h as is in des_locl.h to avoid       undefined functions (memset, etc).     - Put a .cvsignore in the aes directory too.
      - libtool finally annoyed me too much, so I'm nuking it,     - tidy up some output,     - print a warning when running an SSL server with no cert,     - only log each connect/disconnect if the new &quot;-out_conns&quot; switch is used.
      - Network errors could pollute the buffers because -1 isn't noticed in an       &quot;unsigned int&quot;.     - Remove redundant processing with machine-&gt;ssl is NULL.     - Remove compiler warnings about uninitialised 'ctx' (it's not used       uninitialised, but gcc can't see that).
      The sample certs had expired, so these are newer ones that should last     quite a bit longer.
      Produce less confusing statistics when &quot;-out_totals&quot; is used.
      Correct for the recent prototype changes.
      The 'type' parameter, an EVP_MD pointer, represents the type of digest     required as well as a default implementation (when no ENGINE provides a     replacement implementation). This change makes sure the correct     implementation's &quot;init()&quot; handler is used rather than assuming 'type'.
      - Add support for cipher suites that require a temporary RSA key for       key-agreement.     - Tolerate signal interruptions of select().
      Make the &quot;ungunk&quot; logic a little more robust.
      A rough little self-test for tunala. This runs through all cipher-suite /     SSL/TLS version combinations looking for mishaps.
      make update
      This adds a new ENGINE to support IBM 4758 cards, contributed by Maurice     Gittens.
      This apparently fixes compilation on OSX that was failing in 0.9.7 betas.
      Make sure any ENGINE control commands make local copies of string     pointers passed to them whenever necessary. Otherwise it is possible the     caller may have overwritten (or deallocated) the original string data     when a later ENGINE operation tries to use the stored values.
      Correct an error in the README.ENGINE file.
      oops, there were other cases of &quot;ENGINE_ID&quot; to change too.
      This documentation change was being written at the same time as Richard's     changes. So I'm committing this version to overwrite his changes for now,     and he can always take his turn to overwrite my words if he wants :-)
      Fix &quot;make install_docs&quot; (and thus &quot;make install&quot;).
      A single monolithic man page for the ENGINE stuff. This is a rough     first-cut but provides better documentation than having nothing on the     ENGINE API.
      Various parts of the RSA documentation were inaccurate and out of date and     this fixes those that I'm currently aware of. In particular, the ENGINE     interference in the RSA API has hopefully been clarified. This still needs     to be done for other areas of the API ...
      typo fix
      These are updates/fixes to DH/DSA/RAND docs based on the fixes to the RSA     docs. There were a couple of other places (including RSA) where the docs     were not quite synchronised with the API that are now fixed. One or two     still remain to be fixed though ...
      Fix a bug to allow the 4758 ENGINE to build as a DSO.
      - Remo Inverardi noticed that ENGINEs don't have an &quot;up_ref&quot; function in the     normal 'structural' case (ENGINE_init() satisfies this in the less normal     'functional' case). This change provides such a function.
      The ENGINE implementations in ./engines/ should be role models on how to     write external engines (and thus should require only installed openssl     headers and libs to compile without warnings). So this gets rid of recently     introduced compilation warnings (no longer including internal headers) by     including string.h directly.
      The loop variable is 'l', not 'i'.
      We need to propogate SHARED_LIBS to sub-directories for &quot;install&quot; targets     now.
      Another ENGINE implementation dependant on string.h.
      If dynamically-loadable ENGINEs are linked against a shared-library version     of libcrypto, then it is possible that when they are loaded they will share     the same static data as the loading application/library. This means it will     be too late to set memory/ERR/ex_data/[etc] callbacks, but entirely     unnecessary to try. This change puts a static variable in the core ENGINE     code (contained in libcrypto) and a function returning a pointer to it. If     the loaded ENGINE's return value from this function matches the loading     application/library's return value - they share static data. If they don't     match, the loaded ENGINE has its own copy of libcrypto's static data and so     the callbacks need to be set.
      Make pod2man happier.
      Correct and enhance the behaviour of &quot;internal&quot; session caching as it     relates to SSL_CTX flags and the use of &quot;external&quot; session caching. The     existing flag, &quot;SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_LOOKUP&quot; remains but is     supplemented with a complimentary flag, &quot;SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_STORE&quot;.     The bitwise OR of the two flags is also defined as     &quot;SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL&quot; and is the flag that should be used by most     applications wanting to implement session caching *entirely* by its own     provided callbacks. As the documented behaviour contradicted actual     behaviour up until recently, and since that point behaviour has itself been     inconsistent anyway, this change should not introduce any compatibility     problems. I've adjusted the relevant documentation to elaborate about how     this works.
      The last character of inconsistency in my recent commits is hereby     squashed.
      The recent CHANGES note between 0.9.6g and 0.9.6h needs copying into the     other branches.
      Add a HISTORY section to the man page to mention the new flags.
      Fix a warning, and do some constification as a lucky side-effect :-)
      This is a first-cut at improving the callback mechanisms used in     key-generation and prime-checking functions. Rather than explicitly passing     callback functions and caller-defined context data for the callbacks, a new     structure BN_GENCB is defined that encapsulates this; a pointer to the     structure is passed to all such functions instead.
      Undefine OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED inside openssl application code if we are     being built with it defined - it is not a symbol to affect how openssl     itself builds, but to alter the way openssl headers can be used from an API     point of view. The &quot;deprecated&quot; function wrappers will always remain inside     OpenSSL at least as long as they're still being used internally. :-)
      Nils Larsch submitted;       - a patch to fix a memory leak in rsa_gen.c       - a note about compiler warnings with unions       - a note about improving structure element names
      This stops a compiler warning from -Wmissing-prototypes.     (Noticed by Nils Larsch)
      Make 'tunala' link with zlib if possible (so it works if openssl was     configured with zlib support).
      The ampersand is not required in these constructs, and was giving AIX     warnings.
      This is the first step in allowing RSA_METHODs to implement their own key     generation. This prototype matches the new API function     RSA_generate_key_ex(), though both may be subject to change during     development before 0.9.8.
      RSA_METHOD now supports key-generation, but (for now) none of these     ENGINEs implement it.
      As with RSA, which was modified recently, this change makes it possible to     override key-generation implementations by placing handlers in the methods     for DSA and DH. Also, parameter generation for DSA and DH is possible by     another new handler for each method.
      &quot;openssl engine&quot; will not display ENGINE/DSO load failure errors when     testing availability of engines with &quot;-t&quot; - the old behaviour of is     produced by increasing the feature's verbosity with &quot;-tt&quot;.
      Commit a slightly modified version of an old experiment to do RSA private     key operations using the GMP library. The default is not to build (or use)     this code unless OPENSSL_USE_GMP is defined (because it will impose header     and linker dependencies that might need specifying too).
      This glues the GMP wrapper ENGINE into OpenSSL if it is being built (ie. if     the OPENSSL_USE_GMP symbol is defined). Also, I've re-ordered the listing     of other builtin ENGINEs to be alphabetical (though &quot;dynamic&quot; will still     come first).
      Summarise the last couple of commits.
      David Brumley &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">dbrumley at stanford.edu</A>&gt; noted and corrected a case in the     verification step of CRT private key operations in the RSA code -     previously no montgomery form was checked or used for 'n', and so it would     be generated on the fly each time. As a result, private key operations are     now a percent or two faster.
      We cache a montgomery form for 'n' if the PUBLIC flag is set, not PRIVATE.
      Declare prototypes for function pointer types, even if they are likely to     be cast later on.
      Session cache implementations shouldn't have to access SSL_SESSION     elements directly, so this missing functionality is required.
      The default implementation of DSA_METHOD has an interdependence on the     dsa_mod_exp() and bn_mod_exp() handlers from dsa_do_verify() and     dsa_sign_setup(). When another DSA_METHOD implementation does not define     these lower-level handlers, it becomes impossible to do a fallback to     software on errors using a simple DSA_OpenSSL()-&gt;fn(key).
      Fix a bone-head bug. This warrants a CHANGES entry because it could affect     applications if they were passing a bogus 'flags' parameter yet having     things work as they wanted anyway.
      This memset() in the ubsec ENGINE is a bug. Zeroing out the result array     should not be necessary in any case, but more importantly the result and     input BIGNUMs could be the same, in which case this is clearly a problem.
      These should be write-locks, not read-locks.
      Remove duplicate prototypes have already been (correctly) added to rsa.h,     as this is already included by x509.h anyway.
      crypto/evp/evptests.txt is copied to tests/ rather than symlinked because     of windows (see checkin 1.75 of crypto/evp/Makefile.ssl), so quiet cvs     noise for the copied version.
      Ignore derived file.
      make update
      Add my own debug config target.
      The &quot;cryptodev&quot; engine preprocessor logic used undefined symbols in     comparisons. It's better not to allow this, because it gives false     positives when using compiler warnings that detect mistyped symbols.
      When OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED is defined, deprecated functions are (or should     be) precompiled out in the API headers. This change is to ensure that if     it is defined when compiling openssl, the deprecated functions aren't     implemented either.
      Update any code that was using deprecated functions so that everything builds     and links with OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED defined.
      For whatever reason (compiler or header bugs), at least one commonly-used     linux system (namely mine) chokes on our definitions and uses of the &quot;HZ&quot;     symbol in crypto/tmdiff.[ch] and apps/speed.c as a &quot;bad function cast&quot;     (when in fact there is no function casting involved at all). In both cases,     it is easily worked around by not defining a cast into the macro and     jiggling the expressions slightly.
      Avoid &quot;empty source file&quot; warnings.
      Comments out some unimplemented functions instead of redeclaring them.
      Relax some over-zealous constification that gave some lhash-based code no     choice but to have to cast away &quot;const&quot; qualifiers from their prototypes.     This does not remove constification restrictions from hash/compare     callbacks, but allows destructor commands to be run over a tables' elements     without bad casts.
      Remove redundant declaration.
      Remove an unnecessary cast that causes certain compilers (eg. mine) some     confusion. Also silence a couple of signed/unsigned warnings.
      remove accidentally committed debugging cruft.
      BN_CTX is opaque and the static initialiser BN_CTX_init() is not used     except internally to the allocator BN_CTX_new(), as such this deprecates     the use of BN_CTX_init() in the API. Moreover, the structure definition of     BN_CTX is taken out of bn_lcl.h and moved into bn_ctx.c itself.
      A general spring-cleaning (in autumn) to fix up signed/unsigned warnings.     I have tried to convert 'len' type variable declarations to unsigned as a     means to address these warnings when appropriate, but when in doubt I have     used casts in the comparisons instead. The better solution (that would get     us all lynched by API users) would be to go through and convert all the     function prototypes and structure definitions to use unsigned variables     except when signed is necessary. The proliferation of (signed) &quot;int&quot; for     strictly non-negative uses is unfortunate.
      Some provisional bignum debugging has begun to detect inconsistent BIGNUM     structures being passed in to or out of API functions, and this corrects a     couple of cases found so far.
      Make md32_common.h friendlier to compiler warnings.     Obtained from: Andy Polyakov &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">appro at openssl.org</A>&gt;
      Oops, this file already had the &quot;empty source file&quot; workaround but it     requires -DPEDANTIC and was hidden at the bottom of the file. This moves it     to the top and removes the redundant declaration.
      Copy-n-paste bug (don't mix variable declarations and code). This sets the     callback structure just before it is needed.
      Remove a line that was causing redundant declarations.     Obtained from: Stephen Henson &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">steve at openssl.org</A>&gt;
      Tighten up my compiler settings.
      make update
      This fixes a couple of cases where an inconsistent BIGNUM could be passed as     input to a function.
      When a BN_CTX is used for temporary workspace, the variables are sometimes     left in an inconsistent state when they are released for later reuse. This     change resets the BIGNUMs when they are released back to the context.
      bn_div() does some pretty nasty things with temporary variables,     constructing BIGNUM structures with pointers offset into other bignums     (among other things). This corrects some of it that is too plainly insane,     and tries to ensure that bignums are normalised when passed to other     functions.
      This is the least unacceptable way I've found for declaring the bignum data     and structures as constant without having to cast away const at any point.     There is still plenty of other code that makes gcc's &quot;-Wcast-qual&quot; unhappy,     but crypto/bn/ is now ok. Purists are welcome to suggest alternatives.
      Avoid some shadowed variable names.     Submitted by: Nils Larsch
      Put the first stage of my bignum debugging adventures into CVS. This code     is itself experimental, and in addition may cause execution to break on     existing openssl &quot;bugs&quot; that previously were harmless or at least     invisible.
      This is a revert of my previous commit to &quot;improve&quot; the declaration of     constant BIGNUMs. It turns out that this trips up different but equally     useful compiler warnings to -Wcast-qual, and so wasn't worth the ugliness     it created. (Thanks to Ulf for the forehead-slap.)
      Put more debug screening in BN_div() and correct a comment.
      Add debug-screening of input parameters to some functions I'd missed     before.
      This extends the debugging macros to use &quot;pollution&quot; during     bn_correct_top(), previously only bn_check_top() did this.
      Avoid possible memory leaks in error-handling.
      General improvements to the ec_asn1.c code. This squashes at least one bug     (where it was impossible to create an EC certificate with a compressed     public key), and has some style improvements based on some comments from     Steve Henson about use of the ASN1 macros.
      This rewrites two &quot;for&quot; loops in BN_rshift() - equality with zero is     generally a more efficient comparison than comparing two integers, and the     first of these two loops was off-by-one (copying one too many values). This     change also removes a superfluous assignment that would set an unused word     to zero (and potentially allow an overrun in some cases).
      Fix a small bug in str_copy: if more than one variable is replaced, make     sure the current length is used to calculate the new buffer length instead     of using the old length (prior to any variable substitution).
      BN_div() cleanup: replace the use of BN_sub and BN_add with bn_sub_words     and bn_add_words to avoid using fake bignums to window other bignums that     can lead to corruption. This change allows all bignum tests to pass with     BN_DEBUG and BN_DEBUG_RAND debugging and valgrind. NB: This should be     tested on a few different architectures and configuration targets, as the     bignum code this deals with is quite preprocessor (and assembly) sensitive.
      Some changes for bn_gf2m.c: better error checking plus some minor     optimizations.
      Fix some handling in bn_word. This also resolves the issues observed in     ticket 697 (though uses a different solution than the proposed one). This     problem was initially raised by Otto Moerbeek.
      Due to recent debugging bursts, openssl should be more or less solid     against inconsistent BIGNUMs coming out of any of its API functions. So     this change no longer &quot;fixes&quot; the bn_print.c functions, but it makes for     cleaner code. This patch was a part of ticket 697.
      Get rid of some signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      This improves the placement of check_top() macros in a couple of bn_lib     functions.
      Make BN_DEBUG_RAND less painfully slow by only consuming one byte of     pseudo-random data for each bn_pollute().
      Improve a couple of the bignum macros. Note, this doesn't eliminate     tolerance of ambiguous zero-representation, it just improves     BN_abs_is_word() and simplifies other macros that depend on it.
      If BN_STRICT is defined, don't accept an ambiguous representation of zero     (ie. where top may be zero, or it may be one if the corresponding word is     set to zero). Note, this only affects the macros in bn.h, there are probably     similar corrections required in some c files.
      Add more debugging to my Configure target, and &quot;make update&quot; to incorporate     this and a few other changes.
      bn_fix_top() exists for compatibility's sake and is mapped to     bn_correct_top() or bn_check_top() depending on debug settings. For     internal source, all bn_fix_top()s should be converted one way or the other     depending on whether the use of bn_correct_top() is justified.
      The bn_set_max() macro is only &quot;used&quot; by the bn_set_[low|high]() macros     which, in turn, are used nowhere at all. This is a good thing because     bn_set_max() would currently generate code that wouldn't compile (BIGNUM     has no 'max' element).
      Add missing bn_check_top()s to bn_gf2m.c and remove some miscellaneous     white-space.
      Add missing bn_check_top()s to bn_kron.c, remove some miscellaneous     white-space, and include extra headers to satisfy debugging builds.
      Declare the static BIGNUM &quot;BN_value_one()&quot; more carefully.
      BN_FLG_FREE is of extremely dubious usefulness, and is only referred to     once in the source (where it is set for the benefit of no other code     whatsoever). I've deprecated the declaration in the header and likewise     made the use of the flag conditional in bn_lib.c. Note, this change also     NULLs the 'd' pointer in a BIGNUM when it is reset but not deallocated.
      Use the BN_is_odd() macro in place of code that (inconsistently) does much     the same thing.
      Incremental cleanups to bn_lib.c.     - Add missing bn_check_top() calls and relocate some others     - Use BN_is_zero() where appropriate     - Remove assert()s that bn_check_top() is already covering     - Simplify the code in places (esp. bn_expand2())     - Only keep ambiguous zero handling if BN_STRICT isn't defined     - Remove some white-space and make some other aesthetic tweaks
      minor signed/unsigned warning fixes
      When adding positive elements, we can use BN_uadd() instead of BN_add().
      A cleanup of the ecs_ossl.c code and some (doxygen) comments for ecdsa.h
      Add ECDSA documentation.
      More changes coming out of the bignum auditing. BN_CTX_get() should ideally     return a &quot;zero&quot; bignum as BN_new() does - so reset 'top'. During     BN_CTX_end(), released bignums should be consistent so enforce this in     debug builds. Also, reduce the number of wasted BN_clear_free() calls from     BN_CTX_end() (typically by 75% or so).
      Minimise the amount of code dependent on BN_DEBUG_RAND. In particular,     redefine bn_clear_top2max() to be a NOP in the non-debugging case, and     remove some unnecessary usages in bn_nist.c.
      static
      Document a change I'd already made, and at the same time, correct the     change to work properly; BN_zero() should set 'neg' to zero as well as     'top' to match the behaviour of BN_new().
      The efforts to eliminate the dual-representation of zero and to ensure     bignums are passed in and out of functions and APIs in a consistent form     has highlighted that zero-valued bignums don't need any allocated word     data. The use of BN_set_word() to initialise a bignum to zero causes     needless allocation and gives it a return value that must be checked. This     change converts BN_zero() to a self-contained macro that has no     return/expression value and does not cause any expansion of bignum data.
      Convert openssl code not to assume the deprecated form of BN_zero().
      Variety of belt-tightenings in the bignum code. (Please help test this!)
      Note my bignum hijinx in case app maintainers are using CHANGES for their     porting efforts. Also, add Richard's name to the prior change.
      Protect against gcc's &quot;warning: cast does not match function type&quot;.
      Remove some warnings.
      Damn, I was a bit hasty with my fix and hadn't spotted the linker     dependency from asn1.
      By adding a BN_CTX parameter to the 'rsa_mod_exp' callback, private key     operations no longer require two distinct BN_CTX structures. This may put     more &quot;strain&quot; on the current BN_CTX implementation (which has a fixed limit     to the number of variables it will hold), but so far this limit is not     triggered by any of the tests pass and I will be changing BN_CTX in the     near future to avoid this problem anyway.
      ... and this should likewise fix up those RSA implementations that weren't     already built and tested.
      Adds warnings about two curves and fixes the &quot;seed&quot; value for two other     curves.
      Replace the BN_CTX implementation with my current work. I'm leaving the     little TODO list in there as well as the debugging code (only enabled if     BN_CTX_DEBUG is defined).
      Adjust various bignum functions to use BN_CTX for variables instead of     locally initialising their own.
      Avoid undefined results when the parameter is out of range.
      Reduce header interdependencies, initially in engine.h (the rest of the     changes are the fallout). As this could break source code that doesn't     directly include headers for interfaces it uses, changes to recursive     includes are covered by the OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED symbol. It's better to     define this when building and using openssl, and then adapt code where     necessary - this is how to stay current. However the mechanism exists for     the lethargic.
      (oops) Apologies all, that last header-cleanup commit was from the wrong     tree. This further reduces header interdependencies, and makes some     associated cleanups.
      header cleanup in apps/
      When generating dependencies in the makefiles, generate the reduced     dependencies of the OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED mode. This prevents dependencies     being reproduced for &quot;deprecated&quot; header behaviour when a developer doesn't     define the symbol (with the subsequent CVS wars that can ensue).
      More updates for the header cleanups (and apologies, again, for not having     consolidated these prior to committing).
      &quot;make update&quot; noticed a new function.
      make update
      Extend the index parameter checking from sk_value to sk_set(). Also tidy up     some similar code elsewhere.
      As far as I can tell, the bugfix this comment refers to was committed to     0.9.7-stable as well as HEAD (and doesn't apply to the 0.9.6-engine     variant).
      Allow RSA key-generation to specify an arbitrary public exponent. Jelte     proposed the change and submitted the patch, I jiggled it slightly and     adjusted the other parts of openssl that were affected.
      The problem of rsa key-generation getting stuck in a loop for (pointlessly)     small key sizes seems to result from the code continually regenerating the     same prime value once the range is small enough. From my tests, this change     fixes the problem by setting an escape velocity of 3 repeats for the second     of the two primes.
      With the new dynamic BN_CTX implementation, there should be no need for     additional contexts.
      The new BN_CTX code makes this sort of abuse unnecessary.
      Fix realloc usage in ec_curve.c
      This file implements various functions that have since been redefined as     macros. I'm removing this from the NO_DEPRECATED build.
      Make some more API types opaquely available from ossl_typ.h, meaning the     corresponding headers are only required for API functions or structure     details. This now includes the bignum types and BUF_MEM. Subsequent commits     will remove various dependencies on bn.h and buffer.h and update the     makefile dependencies.
      Moving opaque definitions to ossl_typ.h lets us reduce header dependencies.     Deprecate inclusion of crypto.h from ui.h.
      Reduce dependencies on crypto.h by moving the opaque definition of     CRYPTO_EX_DATA and the new/free/dup callback prototypes to ossl_typ.h.
      Deprecate some recursive includes from the store.h API header, and put back     required includes back via the internal header and str_lib.c.
      Deprecate quite a few recursive includes from the ssl.h API header and     remove some unnecessary includes from the internal header ssl_locl.h. This     then requires adding includes for bn.h in four C files.
      The inclusion of bn.h from the engine.h API header has been deprecated, so     the engine implementations need to include bn.h to manipulate bignums.
      I can't verify this directly, but recent changes will probably require that     the cryptodev implementation include bn.h directly (when building with     OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED that is).
      Because of recent reductions in header interdependencies, these files need     to include crypto.h directly.
      Remove some unnecessary recursive includes from the internal apps.h header,     and include bn.h in those C files that need bignum functionality.
      Deprecate the recursive includes of bn.h from various API headers (asn1.h,     dh.h, dsa.h, ec.h, ecdh.h, ecdsa.h, rsa.h), as the opaque bignum types are     already declared in ossl_typ.h. Add explicit includes for bn.h in those C     files that need access to structure internals or API functions+macros.
      After the latest round of header-hacking, regenerate the dependencies in     the Makefiles. NB: this commit is probably going to generate a huge posting     and it is highly uninteresting to read.
      This fixes the installation target for dynamic engines, which was trying to     install to a different location than it had created. (BTW, VMS will need a     matching fix in eng_list.c.) Note, these aren't ssl-specific, so I'm     putting &quot;engines/&quot; into the libs directory rather than at the &quot;--prefix&quot;     level or inside &quot;ssl/&quot;.
      &quot;no-engine&quot; was being ignored, so remove it from the advertised syntax.     Also remove some commented-out lines of code that deny CVS its purpose.
      Correct the return codes for ecdsatest.
      BN_div_word() was breaking when called from BN_bn2dec() (actually, this is     the only function that uses it) because it would trip up an assertion in     bn_div_words() when first invoked. This also adds BN_div_word() testing to     bntest.
      As Nils put it;
      Tweak my debug target flags.
      Get rid of signed/unsigned warnings, and teach CVS about new things to     ignore.
      Actually, that last change to BN_get_word() was a little too simple.
      Minor change to group like functions together.
      Attempt to bring the 'engine' documentation up to date w.r.t missing     prototypes, etc. Also, some fairly significant edits were made to the text     (who wrote this crap anyway? oh wait ...), removing stuff which is     overkill, rewriting stuff that was opaque, correcting things that were just     downright false, etc.
      Deprecate unused cruft, and &quot;make update&quot;.
      Incomplete initial sweep over the engine code. Mainly reducing some     comment-noise to managable levels and inverting the sense of the &quot;uptodate&quot;     boolean (which was counter-intuitive the way I'd left it).
      Tidy up, including;     - Remove unused and unuseful debug cruft.     - Remove unnecessary 'top' fudging from BN_copy().     - Fix a potential memory leak and simplify the expansion logic in       BN_bin2bn().
      Improve error handling if decompression of an ec point fails, and cleanup     ec_curve.c (unify comments, etc).

      Fix a variety of warnings generated by some elevated compiler-fascism,     OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED, etc. Steve, please double-check the CMS stuff...
      Fork my debug configuration into 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
      Comment out a (currently) unused CMS function. (Sorry Steve, but I need     -Werror right now to help me code-by-domino :-)
      Update tunala so it builds ok with OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED, and improve the     autoungunk.sh logic (autobits have grown since I last tried this...).
      There was a need to support thread ID types that couldn't be reliably cast     to 'unsigned long' (ie. odd platforms/compilers), so a pointer-typed     version was added but it required portable code to check *both* modes to     determine equality. This commit maintains the availability of both thread     ID types, but deprecates the type-specific accessor APIs that invoke the     callbacks - instead a single type-independent API is used.  This simplifies     software that calls into this interface, and should also make it less     error-prone - as forgetting to call and compare *both* thread ID accessors     could have led to hard-to-debug/infrequent bugs (that might only affect     certain platforms or thread implementations). As the CHANGES note says,     there were corresponding deprecations and replacements in the     thread-related functions for BN_BLINDING and ERR too.
      Paul Sheer optimised the OpenSSL to/from libGMP conversions for the case     where they both use the same limb size. I've tweaked his patch slightly, so     blame me if it breaks.
      Fix auto-discovery of ENGINEs. See the CHANGES entry for details (and/or     ticket #1668).
      Revert my earlier CRYPTO_THREADID commit, I will commit a reworked     version some time soon.
      If --prefix=&quot;C:\foo\bar&quot; is supplied to Configure for a windows target,     then the backslashes need escaping to avoid being treated as switches in     the auto-generated strings in opensslconf.h. Perl users are welcome to     suggest a less hokey way of doing this ...
      Fix signed/unsigned warning.
      Remove the dual-callback scheme for numeric and pointer thread IDs,     deprecate the original (numeric-only) scheme, and replace with the     CRYPTO_THREADID object. This hides the platform-specifics and should reduce     the possibility for programming errors (where failing to explicitly check     both thread ID forms could create subtle, platform-specific bugs).
      Correct the FAQ and the threads man page re: CRYPTO_THREADID changes.
      Fix build warnings.
      Use of a 'top' var creates &quot;shadow variable&quot; warnings.
      Apparently '__top' is also risky, obfuscate further. (All this to     avoid inlines...)
      Revert the size_t modifications from HEAD that had led to more     knock-on work than expected - they've been extracted into a patch     series that can be completed elsewhere, or in a different branch,     before merging back to HEAD.

      Add automatic query of EGD sockets to RAND_poll(). The EGD sockets are     only queried when the /dev/[u]random devices did not return enough     entropy. Only the amount of entropy missing to reach the required minimum     is queried, as EGD may be drained.     Queried locations are: /etc/entropy, /var/run/egd-pool

No change to the list handling will however solve the problems of incorrect     SSL_SESSION_free() calls. The session list is only one possible point of     failure, dangling pointers would also occur for SSL object currently     using the session. The correct solution is to only use SSL_SESSION_free()     when applicable!

      HP-UX 32bit:     * When linking against shared libraries, the absolute path is remembered.       - When linking against -L.., '..' is remembered inside the executable,         so it will fail after &quot;make install&quot; or when not called from inside the         &quot;apps/&quot; subdirectory of the build tree.       - When using the &quot;+cdp&quot; option of &quot;ld&quot;, the &quot;..&quot; information can be         exchanged against $(INSTALL_TOP)/lib. In this case the executable         will however refuse to work before &quot;make install&quot; has been called.         This makes testing the 'openssl' executable a problem.     * Solution 1:       Relink the &quot;openssl&quot; executable, when &quot;make install&quot; is called.       This would however require significant changes to the toplevel Makefile       and the apps/ Makefile.     * Solution 2:       Statically link against libssl and libcrypto, so that the &quot;openssl&quot;       executable is no longer dependant on the openssl shared libraries.

      Updates to the new SSL compression code          [Eric A. Young, (from changes to C2Net SSLeay, integrated by Mark Cox)]
      Fix assembler for Alpha (tested only on DEC OSF not Linux or *BSD).  The     problem was that one of the replacement routines had not been working since     SSLeay releases.  For now the offending routine has been replaced with     non-optimised assembler.  Even so, this now gives around 95% performance     improvement for 1024 bit RSA signs.
      This corrects the reference count handling in SSL_get_session.     Previously, the returned SSL_SESSION didn't have its reference count     incremented so the SSL_SESSION could be freed at any time causing     seg-faults if the pointer was subsequently used. Code that uses     SSL_get_session must now make a corresponding SSL_SESSION_free() call when     it is done to avoid memory leaks (or blocked up session caches).

      Verify that we have a sensible message len and fail if not     RT#3592 provides an instance where the OPENSSL_assert that this commit     replaces can be hit. I was able to recreate this issue by forcing the     underlying BIO to misbehave and come back with very small mtu values. This     happens the second time around the while loop after we have detected that the     MTU has been exceeded following the call to dtls1_write_bytes.
      The SSL_OP_NO_QUERY_MTU option is supposed to stop the mtu from being     automatically updated, and we should use the one provided instead.     Unfortunately there are a couple of locations where this is not respected.
      The first call to query the mtu in dtls1_do_write correctly checks that the     mtu that we have received is not less than the minimum. If its less it uses the     minimum instead. The second call to query the mtu does not do that, but     instead uses whatever comes back. We have seen an instance in RT#3592 where we     have got an unreasonably small mtu come back. This commit makes both query     checks consistent.
      There are a number of instances throughout the code where the constant 28 is     used with no explanation. Some of this was introduced as part of RT#1929. The     value 28 is the length of the IP header (20 bytes) plus the UDP header (8     bytes). However use of this constant is incorrect because there may be     instances where a different value is needed, e.g. an IPv4 header is 20 bytes     but an IPv6 header is 40. Similarly you may not be using UDP (e.g. SCTP).     This commit introduces a new BIO_CTRL that provides the value to be used for     this mtu &quot;overhead&quot;. It will be used by subsequent commits.
      Remove instances in libssl of the constant 28 (for size of IPv4 header + UDP)     and instead use the value provided by the underlying BIO. Also provide some     new DTLS_CTRLs so that the library user can set the mtu without needing to     know this constant. These new DTLS_CTRLs provide the capability to set the     link level mtu to be used (i.e. including this IP/UDP overhead). The previous     DTLS_CTRLs required the library user to subtract this overhead first.
      Fix dtls_query_mtu so that it will always either complete with an mtu that is     at least the minimum or it will fail.     There were some instances in dtls1_query_mtu where the final mtu can end up     being less than the minimum, i.e. where the user has set an mtu manually. This     shouldn't be allowed. Also remove dtls1_guess_mtu that, despite having     logic for guessing an mtu, was actually only ever used to work out the minimum     mtu to use.
      If we really get a situation where the underlying mtu is less than the minimum     we will support then dtls1_do_write can go into an infinite loop. This commit     fixes that.
      Updates to s_client and s_server to remove the constant 28 (for IPv4 header     and UDP header) when setting an mtu. This constant is not always correct (e.g.     if using IPv6). Use the new DTLS_CTRL functions instead.
      Only use the fallback mtu after 2 unsuccessful retransmissions if it is less     than the mtu we are already using

      Follow on from CVE-2014-3571. This fixes the code that was the original source     of the crash due to p being NULL. Steve's fix prevents this situation from     occuring - however this is by no means obvious by looking at the code for     dtls1_get_record. This fix just makes things look a bit more sane.
      A memory leak can occur in dtls1_buffer_record if either of the calls to     ssl3_setup_buffers or pqueue_insert fail. The former will fail if there is a     malloc failure, whilst the latter will fail if attempting to add a duplicate     record to the queue. This should never happen because duplicate records should     be detected and dropped before any attempt to add them to the queue.     Unfortunately records that arrive that are for the next epoch are not being     recorded correctly, and therefore replays are not being detected.     Additionally, these &quot;should not happen&quot; failures that can occur in     dtls1_buffer_record are not being treated as fatal and therefore an attacker     could exploit this by sending repeated replay records for the next epoch,     eventually causing a DoS through memory exhaustion.

      ssldir.pl did not correctly set the directory in utils/mk1mk.pl when     perl5 was used.
      Some more changes for renaming the binary from ssleay to openssl.     I wonder what eay.c is?
      A couple more ssleay.cnf to openssl.cnf changes
      Binary is now apps/openssl not apps/ssleay so use the new name when     rehashing the test certs
      Various ssleay to openssl fixups
      Reflect change from &quot;ssleay&quot; to &quot;openssl&quot; as the main binary name.     Also document &quot;sh config&quot; as an easier alternative to &quot;./Configure     system&quot;.
      Update scripts to use &quot;openssl&quot; instead of &quot;ssleay&quot;
      The dir is named util/ and better to explicitly call the     perl interpreter because not everyone has it in /usr/local/bin/perl.

      Fix version stuff:
      Puhhh... now we've documented the prototypes of all 214 API &quot;functions&quot;.  This     is a pain to do, because of the various macro definitions which I had to     expand manually to get their prototype :-(
      More structuring and sorting of the SSL API documentation.     And the first steps to descriptions in prosa.
      Some issues for voting
      A hint about the license
      Remove more old temporary files from CVS
      cleanup of apps/ and an answer
      Make GCC happy by removing an unused variable defintion.
      First cut of a cleanup for apps/. First the `ssleay' program is now named     `openssl' and second, the shortcut symlinks for the `openssl &lt;command&gt;' are no     longer created. This way we have a single and consistent command line     interface `openssl &lt;command&gt;', similar to `cvs &lt;command&gt;'.
      A few train of thoughts about the build procedure mess
      More .cvsignore stuff to make CVS quiet on our generated files.
      The dir is named util/ and better to explicitly call the     perl interpreter because not everyone has it in /usr/local/bin/perl.
      Make sure the already existing X509_STORE-&gt;depth variable is initialized     in X509_STORE_new(), but document the fact that this variable is still     unused in the certificate verification process.
      Start keeping track of wishes people make on our mailing lists to make sure we     don't forget them and this way we have them bundled together.
      Fix names in usage page of s_time, s_server and s_client
      One more incorrect name in usage page
      Fill in more contents for the openssl(1) manpage.
      Fixed ms/32all.bat script: `no_asm' -&gt; `no-asm'
      Add CygWin32 platform information to Configure script.
      Change address now that we've the mailing lists established
      Update
      Ignore crypto/x509v3/lib
      Make sure `make rehash' target really finds the `openssl' program.
      Update README file a little bit...
      Reflect correct filename
      Ops, one more reference to 0.9.1c. Make sure we don't forget it...
      First cut for a very conservative source tree cleanup:

      Overhauled the Perl interface (perl/*):
      What is on my ToDo list...
      Remove three more bogus files (2x temp file, 1x trash)
      Remove one more totally bogus source file.     This one is exactly the same as ssl_sess.c.     Thanks to Adam Goodman &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">adam at a-domain.com</A>&gt; for hint.
      Make sure latest Perl versions don't interpret some generated C array as Perl     array code in the crypto/err/err_genc.pl script.
      Ok, propose a release date of March 15th with a code freeze a few days before     so we have enough time for final testing and tarball rolling.
      Remember some open issues and available patches
      Make gcc -Wall happy (&quot;might be used uninitialized...&quot;)
      Fix usage message on gendsa:     1. The dsaparam argument is mandatory and not optional     2. Add a little text what this actually is: a filename
      Get rid of a nasty debugging message which was forgotten here...
      Make `openssl x509 -noout -modulus' functional also for DSA certificates (in     addition to RSA certificates) to match the behaviour of `openssl dsa -noout     -modulus' as it's already the case for `openssl rsa -noout -modulus'.  For RSA     the -modulus is the real &quot;modulus&quot; while for DSA currently the public key is     printed (a decision which was already done by `openssl dsa -modulus' in the     past) which serves a similar purpose.  Additionally the NO_RSA no longer     completely removes the whole -modulus option; it now only avoids using the RSA     stuff. Same applies to NO_DSA now, too.
      Remember good pointers to Montgomery multiplication algorithm     descriptions as pointed out by Dave Carman &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">carman at erols.com</A>&gt;
      Don't hard-code path to Perl interpreter on shebang line of Configure     script. Instead use the usual Shell-&gt;Perl transition trick.
      More CVS ignore stuff...
      Change type of another md_len variable in pk7_doit.c:PKCS7_dataFinal()     from `int' to `unsigned int' because it's a length and initialized by     EVP_DigestFinal() which expects an `unsigned int *'.
      Fix 'port' variable from `int' to `unsigned int' in crypto/bio/b_sock.c
      Fix the cipher decision scheme for export ciphers: the export bits are *not*     within SSL_MKEY_MASK or SSL_AUTH_MASK, they are within SSL_EXP_MASK.  So, the     original variable has to be used instead of the already masked variable.
      Typo
      Move s_server -dcert and -dkey options out of the undocumented feature area     because they are useful for the DSA situation and should be recognized by the     users. Thanks to Steve for the original hint.
      Add a bunch of SSL_xxx() functions for configuring the temporary RSA and DH     private keys and/or callback functions which directly correspond to their     SSL_CTX_xxx() counterparts but work on a per-connection basis. This is needed     for applications which have to configure certificates on a per-connection     basis (e.g. Apache+mod_ssl) instead of a per-context basis (e.g.     s_server).
      Remember one more wish from the users
      Use consistent and existing addresses
      Ops, the logic of the second argument has to be coupled with the != test to     work correctly for the SSL_CTX_xxx situations, too. Now &quot;make test&quot; passes     again fine.
      Get rid of remaining C++-style comments which strict C compilers hate.     (Pointed out by Carlos Amengual).
      Don't install bss_file.c under PREFIX/include/.  It was introduced by Eric     between SSLeay 0.8 and 0.9 and just looks useless and confusing.
      Remove confusing variables in function signatures in files     ssl/ssl_lib.c and ssl/ssl.h. At least the double ctx-variable     confused some compilers.
      Added the new `Includes OpenSSL Cryptography Software' button as     doc/openssl_button.{gif,html} which is similar in style to the old SSLeay     button and can be used by applications based on OpenSSL to show the     relationship to the OpenSSL project.
      Fix GCC warning...     t_req.c: In function `X509_REQ_print':     t_req.c:181: warning: suggest explicit braces to avoid ambiguous `else'
      General source tree makefile cleanups: Made `making xxx in yyy...' display     consistent in the source tree and replaced `/bin/rm' by `rm'.  Additonally     cleaned up the `make links' target: Remove unnecessary semicolons, subsequent     redundant removes, inline point.sh into mklink.sh to speed processing and no     longer clutter the display with confusing stuff. Instead only the actually     done links are displayed.
      Ralf is now using FreeBSD 3.1 which runs ELF instead of a.out...
      Cleaned up the LICENSE document: The official contact for any license     questions now is the OpenSSL core team under <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">openssl-core at openssl.org.</A>  And     add a paragraph about the dual-license situation to make sure people recognize     that _BOTH_ the OpenSSL license _AND_ the SSLeay license apply to the OpenSSL     toolkit.
      Bring the README file in sync and shape a little bit more...
      Add a first cut for a NEWS document similar to what other packages (mostly GNU     packages) provide.  The idea is that because of the large number of CHANGES     entries, this file summarizes the major changes for a brief overview.
      just a little typo
      Reshape the README file out of the existing README stuff     into a single file. Need more cleanup for final release IMHO.
      Move the SSL_CTX_xxx defines at the top of ssl.h to the location of other     SSL_CTX_xxx defines. What was the reason to move them to the top, even before     the copyright and #ifdef HEADER_SSL_H? Hmmm...  when there was and still is a     good reason feel free to reverse this patch, but please document why it is     needed this way.
      Allow DSO flags like -fpic, -fPIC, -KPIC etc. to be specified on the `perl     Configure ...' command line. This way one can compile OpenSSL libraries with     Position Independent Code (PIC) which is needed for linking it into DSOs.
      Typo :-)
      Add a useful kludge to allow package maintainers to specify compiler and other     platforms details on the command line without having to patch the Configure     script everytime: One now can use ``perl Configure &lt;id&gt;:&lt;details&gt;'', i.e.     platform ids are allowed to have details appended to them (seperated by     colons). This is treated as there would be a static pre-configured entry in     Configure's %table under key &lt;id&gt; with value &lt;details&gt; and ``perl Configure     &lt;id&gt;'' is called.  So, when you want to perform a quick test-compile under     FreeBSD 3.1 with pgcc and without assembler stuff you can use ``perl Configure     &quot;FreeBSD-elf:pgcc:-O6:::&quot;'' now, which overrides the FreeBSD-elf entry     on-the-fly.
      Notice freeze state and update my entry
      Two more .cvsignore files for the assembler stuff
      Second round of fixing the OpenSSL perl/ stuff. It now at least compiled fine     under Unix and passes some trivial tests I've now added. But the whole stuff     is horribly incomplete, so a README.1ST with a disclaimer was added to make     sure no one expects that this stuff really works in the OpenSSL 0.9.2 release.     Additionally I've started to clean the XS sources up and fixed a few little     bugs and inconsistencies in OpenSSL.{pm,xs} and openssl_bio.xs.
      Fix Win32 symbol export lists for BIO functions: Added BIO_get_ex_new_index,     BIO_get_ex_num, BIO_get_ex_data and BIO_set_ex_data to ms/libeay{16,32}.def.     I'm not a Win32 hacker, but I think I've done it correctly.
      Let us start with some platform test list...
      Start with some more tarball rolling preparation to make sure it's not     overlooed next Monday:     - rmlinks is no longer existing     - use openssl as the name and not rse     - don't roll the STATUS file into the tarball
      Make `openssl version' output lines consistent.
      typo
      Solaris 2.6 makes still problems.     Details were posted.
      Make it more clear what option -WWW to s_server does.
      Update to current state...
      Two more things we should look at before release
      Update platform test list
      Update
      Let util/clean-depend.pl work also with older Perl 5.00x versions.
      Be less restrictive and allow also `perl util/perlpath.pl /path/to/bin/perl'     in addition to `perl util/perlpath.pl /path/to/bin', because this way one can     also use an interpreter named `perl5' (which is usually the name of Perl 5.xxx     on platforms where an Perl 4.x is still installed as `perl').
      Just cosmetics: replace a tab with a normal space because     the tab always looked too estoeric to my eyes while building... ;)
      Some more source tree cleanups (removed obsolete files crypto/bf/asm/bf586.pl,     test/test.txt and crypto/sha/asm/f.s; changed permission on &quot;config&quot; script to     be executable) and a fix for the INSTALL document.
      Remove confusing hint to non-existing file.  Instead make it clear that one     shouldn't change it manually just here. The util/ssldir.pl script does more     and has to be used for this.  Pointed out by Jacques Supcik     &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">supcik at inf.ethz.ch</A>&gt;.

      update list
      Ops, interrupted commit. Fixed
      Typo
      Update after release...
      Move definitions of IS_SET/IS_SEQUENCE inside crypto/asn1/asn1.h     so they no longer are missing under -DNOPROTO.
      Make sure the RSA OAEP test is skipped under -DRSAref because     OAEP isn't supported when OpenSSL is built with RSAref.
      Add .cvsignore in new pkcs12 directory
      Fix a typo in the X.509v3 docs: cRLSign instead of cRLCertSign is correct     according to the sources.... found by Steffen Dettmer &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">steffen at tfh-berlin.de</A>&gt;.
      Fix a few typos and tabs while I'm poking around in ca.c...
      Make sure a corresponding plain text error message exists for the     X509_V_ERR_CERT_REVOKED/23 error number which can occur when a     verify callback function determined that a certificate was revoked.
      Fix `openssl crl -noout -text' combination where `-noout' killed the `-text'     option at all and this way the `-noout -text' combination was inconsistent in     `openssl crl' with the friends in `openssl x509|rsa|dsa'.
      Add `openssl ca -revoke &lt;certfile&gt;' facility which revokes a certificate     specified in &lt;certfile&gt; by updating the entry in the index.txt file.     This way one no longer has to edit the index.txt file manually for     revoking a certificate. The -revoke option does the gory details now.
      SSL_ALLOW_ENULL was renamed to SSL_FORBID_ENULL some time ago by Ben.

      Ok, give us more time....
      Don't forget that it's freeze time now...
      Protect applications from failing to compile when they     try to directly include opensslv.h.
      Puhhh... today is a very hot day.
      Fix determination of Perl interpreter: A perl or perl5     _directory_ in $PATH was also accepted as the interpreter.
      First cut for a proposed code freeze and release dates (from Steve and me).     All OpenSSL developers: Please feel free to adjust the dates if they still do     not fit into your personal scheduling.
      typo while I poke around...
      consistent style
      A few more ``#ifndef NO_FP_API / #endif'' pairs for consistency.     Hint from: Andrija Antonijevic &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">TheAntony2 at bigfoot.com</A>&gt;
      I don't think this is a real showstopper.  Our internal verify procedure lacks     even more and I consider this more a useful feature request than a release     showstopper.
      Let us prepare for tomorrow...
      Remove the perl stuff also optically from the build procedure,     because it could confuse people (which then send us bug reports)...
      Fix two remaining prototype-related warnings
      Backout the following change:
      Install libRSAglue.a when OpenSSL is build with RSAref.     This should now finally make the RSAref users happy...
      Ok, final fix for `config' script to detect all flavors of FreeBSD     in a more general way.
      Ok, I'll do a few more final platform tests and then I'll roll the 0.9.4     tarball baby for us. PLEASE DO NOT COMMIT ANYTHING UNTIL YOU SEE MY FINAL     COMMITS TO `STATUS' INDICATING THAT WE'VE REACHED 0.9.5-dev.
      Bump version to 0.9.4
      Bump after tarball rolling.     Friends, feel free to start again hacking for 0.9.5... ;)
      Add prototypes for new DSA functions Steve added recently.
      Make gcc 2.95.2 happy again, even under ``-Wall -Wshadow -Wpointer-arith -Wcast-align     -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations -Wnested-externs -Winline''.
      Add an evil cast, because POSIX/SUSv2 define connect(2) require     the second argument to be of type ``struct sockaddr *''.

      Cleanup OPENSSL_NO_xxx, part 1

Richard Levitte (2344):
      Make sure installed files are world readable
      adjust to changes in test/testssl
      adjust to changes in test/Makefile.ssl
      DIFFERENCE doesn't handle long (&gt;255 chars) lines well.  Use BACKUP instead.  No, I'm not joking.
      Adjust to changes in apps/Makefile.ssl
      Adjust to changes in apps/openssl.cnf
      Some new names in asn1.h are longer than 31 chars, which disturbs the VMS C compilers...
      Avoid silly compiler warnings about functions not being declared and an int missing.
      It's possible that considering the configuration file as a binary file     works on Unix and MS-DOS/Windows.  It does not under VMS, so open it     as text.
      Some crypto applications are now being built on Unix, so they should on VMS as well.  Not by default, however.
      Two changes have been made:
      Avoid some silly compiler warnings, and add the change log I forgot :-)
      The info removal code was overcomplicated, and error-prone (references being wrongly decreased).  Fixed.
      Add compilation of x509_trs
      Synchronise VMS scripts with Unix Makefiles
      Use MemCheck_start() instead of CRYPTO_mem_ctrl(), and generate a small leak to test (conditional)
      Rebuild of the OpenSSL memory allocation and deallocation routines.     With this change, the following is provided and present at all times     (meaning CRYPTO_MDEBUG is no longer required to get this functionality):
      Clear out license confusion.
      - Made sure some changed behavior is documented in CHANGES.      - Moved the handling of compile-time defaults from crypto.h to        mem_dbg.c, since it doesn't make sense for the library users to try        to affect this without recompiling libcrypto.      - Made sure V_CRYPTO_MDEBUG_TIME and V_CRYPTO_MDEBUG_THREAD had clear        and constant definitions.      - Aesthetic correction.
      - Added more documentation in CHANGES.      - Made CRYPTO_MDEBUG even less used in crypto.h, giving        MemCheck_start() and MemCheck_stop() only one possible definition.      - Made the values of the debug function pointers in mem.c dependent        on the existence of the CRYPTO_MDEBUG macro, and made the rest of        the code understand the NULL case.
      Synchronising
      Make sure that generated files are labeled as such (except in dofile(), for now)
      Add more info to the memory allocation change log.     Suggested by Bodo.
      Added a comment about Win32.
      Typo...
      Typo
      Tell the truth about list separators.
      Synchronise with the makefiles.
      Cut'n'paste error
      Another name longer than 31 chars
      Beautification and a few entries added.
      It doesn't make sense to try see if these variables are negative, since they're unsigned.
      Give the user the possibility to ask for compilation of only the files     that are directly in crypto/, and prepare for a possible disabling of     certain messages that DEC C spews out.
      Prepare for a possible disabling of certain messages that DEC C spews out.
      Build the crypto test applications as well.
      SOCKETSHR is showing bad declarations again.  However, a simple cast     which does no harm fixes that problem.
      Build the test apps after all of the library has been built.
      A test script to check on the header files
      Avoid converting void * to a function pointer when NULL is defined as     ((void *)0), by have a 0 instead.
      Compaq C 6.2 for VMS will complain when we want to convert     non-function pointers to function pointers and vice versa.     The current solution is to have unions that describe the     conversion we want to do, and gives us the ability to extract     the type of data we want.
      Correct indentation
      Let's make all the example formated the same, shall we?
      Add the PID to the output on Win32.
      Man page section forgotten...
      Update all links so they will be rendered better.
      Made link of reference
      Update all links so they will be rendered better.
      Since pod2man is still evolving, and some sites (among others dev.openssl.org)     don't have a version that will handle the L&lt;foo(1)|foo(1)&gt; construct yet, here     is a copy from my laptop (slightly modifed to work independently of the place     where perl itself resides).
      Use the pod2man that comes with OpenSSL.  Make it so config(5) really     ends up in section 5.
      Added a configuration for myself...
      It works much better when you don't press shift at the wrong moment...
      Declare BN_pseudo_rand().
      Put config in section 5, where it belongs.
      Synchronise with Unix code
      Finally found a form that I like...
      Reimplement so only one synchronous stack is used.  The benefit is     that function pointers are nicely tucker in their structure.
      Synchronise
      Correct one link.
      Typo corrected...
      A proposed freeze and release time has come up.
      First try at documenting the DES (and other algorithms) modes
      des_modes is a section 7 manual, so let's make sure that's where it ends up
      Constify
      Move down the attributions
      Add references to the new passwd utility.
      Add compilation of the new passwd utility.
      A hack to make sure access() will give us the correct answer about the     accessability of an &quot;empty&quot; directory.  Thsi *is* weird, and a better     solution will be provided in apps/ca.c, when I get time to hack at it.
      Add a couple of forgotten $(PERL), and make the code to run pod2html a     tad more readable.
      Time ran away...
      Remove the access() call altogether for VMS, since it doesn't quite     work for directory specifications (this will be reported as a bug to     DEC^H^H^HCompaq).  It could as well be removed for all others as well,     since stat() and open() will return appropriate errors as well, but I     leave that to someone else to decide.
      Cosmetic change.  No, openssl.h.in is not autogenerated :-)
      Make Configure add the configuration options that it was copmiled     with.
      Move the registration of callback functions to special functions     designed for that.  This removes the potential error to mix data and     function pointers.
      Blowfish docs.
      Sync with Unix
      Avoid saving any macros starting with a _, since that can create     trouble if header files are included in some &quot;impropper&quot; order.     It's much better if the application programmer has to specify on his     or her own if _REENTRANT shall be defined and when.
      make update
      Correct a couple of command errors.
      Make it possible to have differing tar versions.
      0.9.5beta1
      Remove structures that are no longer used.
      Status update
      Changes to synchronise with Unix.     (actually, much more is needed, like a real config script)
      Enhance consistency by using BIO_flush() instead of fflush().
      Another test passed
      Some time in history, SSL_CTX_sessions() disappeared.  It is now     restored, but not as a macro this time...
      Update the two threads modules to conform to our recommendations (use     CRYPTO_num_locks() instead of CRYPTO_NUM_LOCKS!), and correct all the     inconsistencies with the rest of OpenSSL.
      New script to compile on systems that already have pthreads in the     system.
      Adjust all the old scripts to deal with the new location.
      Small error fix.
      Since a stack with quite long name is declared here, vms_idhacks.h is     also needed to get around C compilers on VMS that set the symbol limit     to 31 characters.  Bot the macros VMS and __VMS are checked, since     there's no real way to know if e_os.h has been included yet.
      Correct small typo
      For safety, check __VMS as well.
      Compile rand_egd.c on VMS as well.
      Let's avoid compiler warnings over types.
      ftruncate() and fileno() are not supported on all versions of OpenVMS     (they don't really exist before version 7), so that solution was toast.     Instead, let's do it the way it's done on Unix, but then remove older     versions of the file.
      Add support for Unixware 7.  Thanks to Ron Record &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">rr at sco.com</A>&gt; for the     patch.
      The OpenVMS library is most definitely not built for anything but     files, unless it's all in unixly syntax.  We can't guarantee that     right now, so let's skip the whole test suit.  There are other places     (like the open()) where errors are detected anyway.
      Don't include sys/types.h if NO_SYS_TYPES_H is defined.
      Typo corrected.
      Just as in Unix, make sure to generate some kind of &quot;random data&quot;.
      Move to using the same perl code as Makefile.ssl
      Make sure that all test files are gone before starting the tests, or     backup will complain about some version not existing.  Perhaps.
      make update
      Make sure there's some entropy, and log a few more errors.
      A small script to compile mttest.c on VMS as well.
      Add and change docs for the changes that have been made.
      New &quot;target&quot;: CONFIG.  This will build the opensslconf.h file from     what is known about VAX and Alpha running VMS, and from the     opensslconf.h.in (in VMS often named OPENSSLCONF.H_IN) file.
      New logical names to skip algorithms are now supported.     Also, on Alpha, vms.mar is no longer used (it produced a lot of     confusing messages) for BN.  Instead, the assembler part of bn_lcl.h     is used.
      New logical names to skip algorithms are now supported.
      Stop logging all the files that are copied all over the place...
      Change version string to reflect the release of beta 2.
      For lack of a better name, this is now called 0.9.5beta3-dev until the     release.
      OpenVMS often has problems with files with more than on period in it.     Here's instructions on what to do if you get into trouble because of     that.
      A new beta has been released, and one test is documented.
      One test passed for VMS.
      OpenSSL doesn't compile well on OpenVMS/VAX, it seems.
      AIX and HP-UX are passing the tests.
      Update config for the unixware targets by looking at what was done in     Apache's GuessOS (from Apache 1.3.1).
      Make sure to catch UnixWare 7, even if the version is 7.1.1 or     something like that.
      No, the VAX is not a 64 bit architecture.
      Works with gcc 2.8.0 as well.
      Update the OpenVMS/VAX status
      More platforms passed the test.
      Include rand.h so RAND_pseudo_bytes may be declared.     Remove one ampersand so the compiler may complain less.     Make rand() static so it will not conflict with the C RTL.     Make bug() static too, for good measure.
      Short is always promoted to int when passed as a function argument.     This is especially true when it's part of a '...'.
      Typo corrected.
      A few more tests were reported.
      Time for a release
      Tagging has been done, time to switch to 0.9.6-dev.
      Forgot to check correctly for the new options
      I'm experimenting with a hack in dopr() and friends b_printf.c to make     it work like asprintf().
      It started with finding a misplaced #endif.  Then I wanted to see the     structure better.  I hope noone minds, and that it still works.  Steve?
      Make bss_log.c a bit more readable, and implement it for VMS as well.
      Hack b_print.c to implement asprintf() functionality.  Not enabled by     default yet, I wanna play with it a bit more.
      Synchronise
      Let's care about the compiler warnings for both cases, shall we?
      Beautifying.  Sorry, but code that's slammed to the far left is not     very readable in my opinion.
      Let's not lie to the people.
      Check that a password was actually passed, or the user will just get     mysterious crashes.
      Protect variables from potential misinterpretations, for example a     colon which may bite the lesser knowleged...
      Add the possibility (with -ign_eof) to ignore end of file on input but     still not be quiet.  Also make it clear that -quiet implicitely means     -ign_eof as well.
      Correct a potential bug.

      Change the notation and coding of the version to be able to contain     both a patch level and a beta status.  IMHO, it also makes more sense     to have beta status be part of the development status than to have it     be an alternate name for patch levels under special conditions.

      Small documentation bug, probably a cut'n'paste, corrected.
      There have been a number of complaints from a number of sources that names     like Malloc, Realloc and especially Free conflict with already existing names     on some operating systems or other packages.  That is reason enough to change     the names of the OpenSSL memory allocation macros to something that has a     better chance of being unique, like prepending them with OPENSSL_.
      Typo...
      According to Gordon Atwood &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">gordon at cs.ualberta.ca</A>&gt;, stdlib.h is     needed, or size_t won't be defined on SunOS 4.1.4.

      First of all, with the current macros, we should never get any     type-specific stack function.  Second, even when we don't build any of     those functions, DECLARE_STACK_OF lines should not find themselves     into $def.
      Add support for dynamically created and destroyed mutexes.  This will     be needed in some ENGINE code, and might serve elsewhere as well.     Note that it's implemented in such a way that the locking itself is     done through the same CRYPTO_lock function as the static locks.
      Modifications for VMS.
      With the new stack hack macros, there's no need to shorten the names     any more.
      Redo the support for dynamic locks.  First of all, it was terribly     insecure, so a static lock is added to isolate the sensitive parts.     Also, to avoid one thread freeing a lock that is used by another, a     reference counter is added.
      The dynamic thread API changed, and so does the documentation.
      Add the missing callback pointer handling functions.     Also, make sure empty slots of the dynamic lock stack are used.     Actually, I'm not really sure this is the right thing to do, and may     remove it, with an endlessly growing stack as result...
      'make update'
      Small change to accept the command line parameter '-rand file'.  This     parameter takes precedence over the RANDFILE option in the     configuration file.
      Document the change in req.
      Forgot the self-documentation within req.
      Move the certificate and key loading functions to apps.c, so they can     be shared by several applications.
      On case-insensitive systems, the 'install' target gets matched against     the 'INSTALL' file, which means that 9 times of 10, the BlowFish     headers won't get installed.  Avoid this in the same way it's done in     crypto/des/Makefile.ssl, where someone apparently has thought of this...
      Change req so the new parameter '-rand file' uses the given file in     addition to the file given through the RANDFILE option or environment     variable.
      Document the change in req.
      Move add_oid_section to apps.c, so it can be shared by several     applications.  Also, have it and the certificate and key loading     functions take a BIO argument for error output.

      Add a blurb on how to solve the problem with failing compiltaion of sha_dgst.c on Alpha True64 Unix
      Beautification
      I got sick and tired of having to keep track of NIDs when such a thing     could be done automagically, much like the numbering in libeay.num and     ssleay.num.  The solution works as follows:
      Document the change.
      Change the FAQ entry a bit, giving the details as I observed them.
      More experiments show that you can set your data segment size soft     limit higher and thereby get through compilation of sha_dgst.c.

      Redo and enhance the support for building shared libraries.  Currently     there's support for building under Linux and True64 (using examples     from the programming manuals), including versioning that is currently     the same as OpenSSL versions but should really be a different series.
      Show the running line count and definition cont in debug mode.  That     has helped me a bit when I ran into trouble.
      Add a note on installation under Win32.
      &quot;make update&quot;
      This isn't entirely necessary if you do everything right from the     start, but can save you some trouble.  Just ignore &quot;shared&quot; if it     comes up among the given options, at least for now...
      Avoid loops, and make sure that it's possible to still build shared     libraries even if the &quot;shared&quot; configuration option wasn't chosen.
      Add support for solaris shared libraries, currently just experimental     (there's no way to get it through configuration yet).
      Avoid a race condition if another thread happens to remove the error     state at the same time.
      Darrel Hankerson &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">dhankers at cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca</A>&gt; correctly discovered     that of the result pointer to bn_mul was the same as one of the two arguments,     That argument might have it's sign destroyed.  He provided this fix.
      There's a deadlock when ssleay_rand_bytes is called the first time, since     it wants to stir the pool using ssleay_rand_add.  This fix provides the     possibility to call ssleay_rand_add inside a locked state by simply telling     it not to do any locking through a static variable.  This isn't the most     elegant way one could do this, but it does retain thread safety during the     stirring process.
      When data are written out in very small blocks (less than 3 bytes in     size) through the base64 filter, b64_write() messes up it's parameters     in such a way that instead of writing correct base64 output, the first     4 characters of that output is repeated over and over.  This fix     corrects that problem.
      Add the possibility to get hexdumps of unprintable data when using     'openssl asn1parse'.  As a side effect, the functions ASN1_parse_dump     and BIO_dump_indent are added.
      Looks like Win32 builds do not define THREADS.  However, they're still     supporting threads, which means that th assertion is supperbly     dangerous, so make sure it's not compiled under Win32, period.
      In the case where a &lt; 0 and |a| &lt; w, the result (assigned to a) from     BN_add_word becomes wrongly negative...     This was discovered by Darrel Hankerson &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">dhankers at cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca</A>&gt;
      There's a slight possibility that a is 0 in BN_sub_word(), and might     therefore have unallocated parts.  Therefore, a check for the 0 case     is needed, resulting with the same thing as when a is negative.
      If a ip address is successfully parsed, the WSA structure under Win32 wasn't     properly initialised.  Fixed.     Bug reported by DeJuan Jackson &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">djackson at inverge.com</A>&gt;
      Remove casts that are no longer needed.
      Make it so we can dynamically enable memory allocation debugging through the     environment variable OPENSSL_DEBUG_MEMORY (existence is sufficient).  At the     same time, it makes sure that CRYPTO_malloc_debug_init() gets expanded some-     where and thereby tested for compilation.
      A few corrections with the shared library support:
      Add support for shared libraries on Solaris.
      I had completely forgotten that print_table_entry also needed to read the two     &quot;shared&quot; variables on it's own...
      &quot;make update&quot;
      It's probably a good idea to make the shared libraries depend in EX_LIBS.
      We've now covered the shared library support for Solaris, so the -shared hack     in config is no longer needed.
      Added and corrected documentation for the 'shared' option
      *mumble* unicos 10.0.0.3 with Cray Standard C Version 6.2.0.0 has a syslog.h     where the openlog() is declared like this:
      Unicos doesn't have sys/timeb.h.  Fix it by defining the TIMEB macro unless on Unicos.
      On Unicos, openlog() isn't constified, so let's not do that in xopenlog()
      On Unicos, shorts are 8 bytes, so instead, use a structure with 2 32-bit ints, just as in destest.c
      For n &gt; 7, we might get uninitialized (unzeroed) data.     Spotted by &quot;Kyoungho Jeon&quot; &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">k.h.jeon at securesoft.co.kr</A>&gt;.
      Make sure that 'initialized' is zeroed as well when cleaning up.
      Duplicate names detected...
      Abdelilah Essiari &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">aes at george.lbl.gov</A>&gt; reports that for very small     records, EVP_EncodeUpdate() may misbehave.  This happens when there's     a record boundary between the two ending b64 equal signs, which makes     EVP_EncodeUpdate think there has been more than one EOF, and therefore     add an extra NUL at the end of the output buffer.  This fix corrects     that problem.
      The pkcs12 had no way of getting a CA file or path to be used when     building a complete chain.  Now added through the -CAfile and -CApath     arguments.
      Memory leaks fix.  There seems to be more in other parts of OpenSSL...
      Memory leaks fix.  It now looks like all memory leaks, at least around     building complete chains, are gone.
      MD4 implemented.  Assar Westerlund provided the digest code itself and the test utility, I added the bits to get a EVP interface, the command line utility and the speed test
      I forgot this file that Assar provided as well...
      IBMcxx complains that maxmem is as low as 2048 for certain modules     (like all the digests).  Setting maxmem to 16K seems to give the     compiler enough space to do all the optimization it wants.
      Correct the title.  This also fooled the automatic documentation builder     that this was actually the pkcs7 document...

      New option 'ctestall' for mkdef.pl, that makes it not only generate     existing functions, but really all functions that exist in libeay.num     and ssleay.num.  This is a good check on how much we should actually     clean up the number files.

      NULL is not an integer...
      Added BIO_vprintf() and BIO_vsnprintf().  The former because I've     found myself needing it a number of times, the latter for completeness.
      Assar wanted an address change.
      Added OIDs from RFC 2247, 1155, and a few from 1700
      Change the printing mahine used by BIO_printf() and friends so it can     handle an externally provided &quot;static&quot; buffer as well a a dynamic     buffer.  The &quot;static&quot; buffer is filled first, but if overflowed, the     dynamic buffer is used instead, being allocated somewhere i the heap.
      Another thing I'm working on.
      It's not just VMS that needs some symbols to be hacked.  Let's     centralise those hacks in crypto/symhacks.h and use it everywhere it's     needed.
      Major hack of mkdef.pl.  There should be no more need to redo the     process when some symbols are missing.  Instead, all needed info is     saved in the .num files, including what conditions are needed for a     specific symbol to exist.
      *.num rewitten to include the extra information.

      'make update'
      Move up inclusion of conf.h, so non-MONOLITH programs can benefit from     it as well, especially in apps.c.
      A DSO method for VMS was missing, and I had the code lying around...
      Make sure dso_vms.c compiles on other operating systems as well.
      'make update'
      Compile all dso files on VMS as well.
      Add BIO_seek() and BIO_tell() to the BIO control functions manual.
      Move text that isn't really descriptions of the functions in the page     to the NOTES section, and add references to the functions mentioned     (and perhaps a few more).
      VMS didn't work out too well...
      Inform the VMS people that RSAref is no longer needed
      Make sure Compaq C doesn'r complain about dollars, and go around the     incompatibility between function and data pointers.
      A couple of more names need to be shortened for VMS on VAX.
      Some platforms define NULL as ((void *)0).  Unfortunately, a void*     can't be used as a function pointer according the the standards.  Use     a 0 instead and there will be no trouble.
      Tell users that a rewrite might be a good idea.
      Oops, no engine in the main trunk.
      siglen is unsigned, so comparing it to less than 0 is silly, and     generates a compiler warning with Compaq C.
      Use sk_*_new_null() instead of sk_*_new(NULL), since that takes care     of complaints from the compiler about data pointers and function     pointers not being compatible with each other.
      Jeffrey Altman &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">jaltman at columbia.edu</A>&gt; sent me a patch that fixes the     problems with GetCursorInfo, but also adds network statistics and     performance statistics where available.
      Restore the descriptions to conform with the rest of the     documentation.  We'll work on better documents after the release of     0.9.6.

      On VMS, stdout may very well lead to a file that is written to in a     record-oriented fashion.  That means that every write() will write a     separate record, which will be read separately by the programs trying     to read from it.  This can be very confusing.

      make update
      Make the new conf implementatoin bug-compatible with the old one.     Actually, it's a feature that it goes looking at environment     variables.  It's just a pity that it's at the cost of the error     checking...  I'll see if I can come up with a better interface for     this.
      Bump the shared library version (should have been done a while ago).
      Rework the system to generate shared libraries:
      Even when you don't want to create shared libraries, it's a good idea     to have the full extension information, so residual shared libraries     can be removed so the applications and test programs do not get linked     against them by mistake...

      NCONF_get_number() has no error checking at all.  As a replacement,     NCONF_get_number_e() is defined (_e for &quot;error checking&quot;) and is     promoted strongly.  The old NCONF_get_number is kept around for     binary backward compatibility.

      FreeBSD-elf can do threads.

      When building shared libraries on HP-UX 10.20 and HP-UX 11.00 (32bit),     ld warns that -Fl &quot;may not be supported in future releases&quot;.  We know     that, and are doing things in HP-UX 11 (64bit), so turn off that     warning with +vnocompatwarnings.
      For the operating systems where it matters, it is sometimes good to     translate library names by only adding &quot;.so&quot; to them without     prepending them with &quot;lib&quot;.  Add the flag DSO_FLAG_NAME_TRANSLATION_EXT_ONLY     for that purpose.
      On HP-UX, at least when shl_* are used, the libraries have the     extension .sl instead of .so.

      Better error reporting in 'openssl engine'
      'openssl engine' can now list engine capabilities.  The current     implementation is contained in the application, and the capability     string building part should really be part of the engine library.     This is therefore an experimental hack, and will be changed in the     near future.
      Change the engine library so the application writer has to explicitely     load the &quot;external&quot; built-in engines (those that require DSO).  This     makes linking with libdl or other dso libraries non-mandatory.
      Update the standards list to the current status
      Instead of just STACK, use STACK_OF(ASN1_OBJECT).
      Make sure that shared libraries get the internal name engine with the     full version number and not just 0.  This should mark the shared     libraries as not backward compatible.  Of course, this should be     changed again when we can guarantee backward binary compatibility.

      Constify the BIGNUM routines a bit more.  The only trouble were the     two functions that did expansion on in parameters (BN_mul() and     BN_sqr()).  The problem was solved by making bn_dup_expand() which is     a mix of bn_expand2() and BN_dup().
      Make all engines available in the openssl application.
      As a consequence of the BIGNUM constification, the ENGINE code needs a     few small constifying changes, and why not throw in a couple of extras     while I'm at it?

      I've checked again and again.  There really is no need to expand a to     4 times it's size when bn_sqr_recursive() won't look farther than the     original length.  Thereby, constification is no longer a problem.

      Make the definition of bn_add_words() match the definition.
      Remove a declaration for a function that does not exist.
      Remove two bn_wexpand() from BN_mul(), which is a step toward getting     BN_mul() correctly constified, avoids two realloc()'s that aren't     really necessary and saves memory to boot.  This required a small     change in bn_mul_part_recursive() and the addition of variants of     bn_cmp_words(), bn_add_words() and bn_sub_words() that can take arrays     with differing sizes.

      &quot;make update&quot; plus a rewrite of both .num files.
      Correct a typo.
      Check for deselection of KRB5.  In fact, skip it completely on VMS for now...
      Uhmm, the keyword TRUE does not exist of course...
      Remove anything connected to RSAref, since that's gone by now.     Add the C macros OPENSSL_BUILD_SHLIBCRYPTO and OPENSSL_BUILD_SHLIBSSL     to the build of the object files as appropriate for each library.
      Define OPENSSL_EXPORT and OPENSSL_IMPORT and give OPENSSL_EXTERN the     default value OPENSSL_IMPORT.  Explain the use of all those macros.
      If OPENSSL_BUILD_SHLIBCRYPTO (for files that end up as libcrypto     objects) or OPENSSL_BUILD_SHLIBSSL (for files that end up as libssl     objects) is defined, redefine OPENSSL_EXTERN to be OPENSSL_EXPORT.     This is actually only important on Win32, and can safely be ignored in     all other cases, at least for now.
      Document.
      Remove RSAref-related things.
      Since asn1.h gets included recursively from many places, the easiest     is to have asn1.h include e_os.h and e_os2.h.  Of course, this makes     the unofficial &quot;non-export&quot; status of e_os.h a bit delicate...
      Temporary measure: if no KRB5 is defined, add &quot;no-krb5&quot; to the     options.  This is so mk1mf.pl can pick it up from Makefile.
      Look for no-krb5 and add the definition of NO_KRB5 if it's there.     I've no idea were the KRB5 header files and libraries are placed on     Win32.  When there's better knowledge, we might be able to process the     other KRB5-related arguments as well...
      The option line may start with a space, which gives an empty option.     Make sure those are purged...
      Make the DSO code for VMS work again.  First attempt.
      Keep up with the Unixly changes.
      Change RAND_poll for Unix to try a number of devices and only read     them for a short period of time (actually, poll them with select(),     then read() whatever is there), which is about 10ms (hard-coded value)     each.
      Because /dev/urandom has a better chance of giving us a good and     quick answer, take that one first.
      Keep up with Unix code.  It's beginning to be  time to rethink the VMS     build system...
      As response to a user request to be able to use external memory     handling routines that need file name and line number information,     I've added a call level to our memory handling routines to allow that     kind of hooking.

      Increase consistency of header data (some mail readers really do not     like spaces before the semicolon, and besides, other parts of this     file makes the values without those spaces), and move spacing of     continuation lines to support BIO's that break lines after each     write.

      Fix a memory leak in BIO_get_accept_socket().  This leak was small and     only happened when the port number wasn't parsable ot the host wasn't     possible to convert to an IP address.

      Add the -VAfile option to 'openssl ocsp'.  This option will give the     client code certificates to use to only check response signatures.     I'm not entirely sure if the way I just implemented the verification     is the right way to do it, and would be happy if someone would like to     review this.
      The check for request including a nonce and response not having it was     inversed.  Corrected.  Hopefully, this will make it work without     dumping core.

      Make the choice of &quot;makedepend&quot; program choosable through a switch.
      Do not insert things in syms{} and kind{} when parsing the header     files.  Instead, insert proper information in the $def string, which     will be properly munged later on.
      An obvious but hard-to-see cut'n'paste error corrected.
      make update
      Remove temporary files when done.
      Make all configuration macros available for application by making     sure they are available in opensslconf.h, by giving them names starting     with &quot;OPENSSL_&quot; to avoid conflicts with other packages and by making     sure e_os2.h will cover all platform-specific cases together with     opensslconf.h.
      I forgot to document the system identification macros
      Use the new-style system-identity macros.
      Make sure time() is properly declared.
      I'm sick of the warnings about long long...
      Use new-style system-id macros.
      Use new-style system-id macros everywhere possible.  I hope I haven't     missed any.
      Use 0 instead of NULL, at least for function casts, since there are     variants of stdio.h that define NULL in such a way that it's &quot;unsafe&quot;     to use for function pointer casting.
      Include string.h so mem* functions get properly declared.
      Include OpenSSL header files earlier so macros like OPENSSL_SYS_VMS     get a chance to be defined.
      Include string.h so mem* functions get properly declared.
      Use sk_*_new_null() instead of sk_*_new(NULL).  That avoids getting     lots of silly warnings from the compiler.
      DEC C on VMS is pedantic by definition.
      Let VMS catch up.
      Include opensslconf.h or the like early to make sure system macros get     correctly defined.

      Get the right cast for lhash callback functions.
      Get e_os2.h to get all the system definitions correctly.
      OpenVMS catches up.
      I forgot there was a reason why the inclusions and definition of u_int     was made in a certain sequence.  This change restores the earlier     &quot;chain of command&quot;.
      Some functions, like strdup() and strcasecmp(), are defined in     strings.h according to X/Open.
      With later version of DEC C on VMS, some functions (strcmp(), for     example) are declared with some extra linkage information.  This     generates a warning when using the function name as a value to a     regular function pointer with the &quot;correct&quot; definition of the     function.  Therefore, use a macro to cast the appropriate function on     VMS.
      strdup() is a X/Open extension.
      I had forgotten to change mkerr.pl to use the new macro system.
      Modify mkdef.pl to recognise and parse prprocessor conditionals of the     form '#if defined(...) || defined(...) || ...' and '#if !defined(...)     &amp;&amp; !defined(...) &amp;&amp; ...'.  This also avoids the growing number of     special cases it was previously handling (some of them wrongly).
      'make update'
      Include e_os2.h instead of opensslconf.h.     SSL_add_dir_cert_subjects_to_stack is not implemented on WIN32 and     VMS, so declare it the same way.
      Since SSL_add_dir_cert_subjects_to_stack isn't impemented on VMS,     there's no point creating an alias for it.
      When inside a #if 0..#endif, do not define anything.
      Always include opensslconf.h, even if it's already been done before.     The reason is that some parts are only included when certain other     include files have been included.
      Windows does not know of strigs.h or strcasecmp, so when in Windows,     make strcasecmp a macro to _stricmp.
      One indirection level too little compared to the     pre-CRYPTO_MEM_LEAK_CB time.
      Since opensslconf.h might be included over and over, undefine     OPENSSL_UNISTD before redefining it, to avoid compiler warnings.
      Exported header files should not include e_os.h.
      Use e_os2.h rather than opensslconf.h, since some needed macros are     defined there.
      Since RAND_file_name() uses strlen, make sure the number that's     compared to it has the type size_t.  Included the needed headers to     make that happen.
      e_os.h does not belong with the exported headers.  Do not put it there     and make all files the depend on it include it without prefixing it     with openssl/.
      Define the OPENSSL_NO_* macros as NO_* macros for the sake of applications thathaven't yet been changed
      CONF_METHOD is one of the few places where you find MS_FAR.  I can't     really see why we need to define these function pointers with MS_FAR     if it's not done cosistently everywhere.
      e_os.h defines Getenv()
      Define the right macro for Linux and other GNU-based systems to get a correct declaration of strdup()
      make depend.
      Add the CCITT pilot directory OIDs.

      Introduce the possibility to access global variables through     functions on platform were that's the best way to handle exporting     global variables in shared libraries.  To enable this functionality,     one must configure with &quot;EXPORT_VAR_AS_FN&quot; or defined the C macro     &quot;OPENSSL_EXPORT_VAR_AS_FUNCTION&quot; in crypto/opensslconf.h (the latter     is normally done by Configure or something similar).
      Spelling corrected.
      Sort platforms lexicographically as well.  Also, support more than two     variants of a symbol.
      For SSLv2, return the SSLv2 method, not the SSLv23 method.  This way,     it's possible to reuse an SSLv2 session.

      gcc uses collect2, not ld, to link things.  Therefore, when using gcc     there's no need fooling ourselves, it's the gnu-shared method that we     should use.  Do it for Solaris to begin with.
      When using the native tools on Solaris, make damn sure the native ld     is used, even if the user has GNU ld earlier in his $PATH.

      Restore asm/mips3.s to be compiled and linked in, since the bug has     (at least hopefully :-)) been fixed.
      Add news section for OpenSSL 0.9.6a.  Please add what's missing
      Since there has been reports of clashes between OpenSSL's     des_encrypt() and des_encrypt() defined on some systems (Solaris and     Unixware and maybe others), we rename des_encrypt() to des_encrypt1().     This should have very little impact on external software unless     someone has written a mode of DES, since that's all des_encrypt() is     meant for.

      Some platforms (most notably Windows) do not have a $HOME by default.     For those, unless the environment variables RANDFILE or HOME are     defined (the default case!), RAND_file_name() will return NULL.     This change adds a default HOME for those platforms.
      Add a general user interface API.  This is designed to replace things     like des_read_password and friends (backward compatibility functions     using this new API are provided).  The purpose is to remove prompting     functions from the DES code section as well as provide for prompting     through dialog boxes in a window system and the like.

      VMS doesn't support more than on period in a file name
      We had the password callback for ENGINEs pretty much wrong.  And     passwords that were given to the key loading functions were completely     ignored, at least in the ncipher code, and then we made the assumption     that the callback wanted a prompt as user argument.
      Document the latest change in ENGINEs.
      A wish was expressed.
      Extend all the loading functions to take an engine pointer, a pass     string (some engines may have certificates protected by a PIN!) and     a description to put into error messages.
      Don't decrement the reference counter twice when destroying dynamic     links.

      Small detail about AIX forgotten...
      A good use of the UI interface is as a password callback replacement     (for new functions...).  One might still want to be able to pass down     a user-data pointer to be used by the UI.  However, ex_data doesn't     quite cut it, since that means the appropriate index to it might need     to be shared between parts that aren't really related in that sense,     and would require the currently hidden (static) index holders to be     uncovered.  Not a good thing.  Therefore, add the possibility to add a     user-data pointer to a UI.
      Defining __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED was the wrong thing.  Instead, define     _XOPEN_SOURCE.

      Provide an application-common setup function for engines and use it     everywhere.
      One feature wasn't quite commited yet
      Enhance the user interface with better support for dialog box     prompting, application-defined prompts, the possibility to use     defaults (for example default passwords from somewhere else) and     interrupts/cancelations.
      The default flag should be for default passwords only.  Otherwise,     someone having a default that is not a password will be confused.
      - Add the possibility to control engines through control names but       with arbitrary arguments instead of just a string.     - Change the key loaders to take a UI_METHOD instead of a callback       function pointer.  NOTE: this breaks binary compatibility with       earlier versions of OpenSSL [engine].     - Addapt the nCipher code for these new conditions and add a card       insertion callback.
      Change the common application routines to use a UI_METHOD for password     prompting, even when done through the callback.
      Do a proof of concept.  &quot;openssl genrsa&quot; will make the name of the     file part of the password prompt unless it's standard input...
      cp is only used when DSA is built.
      Modify &quot;openssl engine&quot; to handle and display internal control     commands appropriately.
      Since there is a way to create UI_METHODs, implement a destructor as     well.
      Update my status.
      For the UI functions that return an int, 0 or any positive number is a     success return, any negative number is a failure.  Make sure we check     the return value with that in mind.
      Include the UI error strings.
      New error printing function that gives the possibility to print the     errors through an arbitrary function.
      Implement boolean (yes/no or OK/Cancel, ...) input.

      Make use of new features in UI's.  Among others, the application     password callbak doesn't need to check for sizes any more.
      apps_startup() needs a corresponding apps_shutdown().
      Use apps_shutdown() in all applications, in case someone decides not     to go the monolith way (does anyone do that these days?).
      make update
      Including stdio.h before setting _XOPEN_SOURCE and     _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED wasn't very smart...
      Use the new UI features, among others the new boolean input.
      Make sure we don't return 0 on error.
      Call apps_shutdown() to take down what apps_startup() set up.
      Make better use of load_cert, load_certs and load_key.
      Make get_ip() a bit more strict in it's parsing of IP addresses, and     at the same time a bit more accepting with host names.
      Make better use of load_cert, load_certs and load_key.
      Make better use of load_cert, load_certs and load_key.

      [Forgotten commits?]     Changes to have OpenSSL compile on OS/2.     Contributed by &quot;Brian Havard&quot; &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">brianh at kheldar.apana.org.au</A>&gt;
      Let's include cryptlib.h *before* things like NO_SYSLOG are tested or     used.
      Make an extra note about shared libraries and backward compatibility.
      Change info to correct values.
      Use one address consistently.
      Patches from Vern Staats &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">staatsvr at asc.hpc.mil</A>&gt; to get Kerberos 5 in     SSL according to RFC 2712.  His comment is:
      If I define _XOPEN_SOURCE before including *any* system header file,     things will work much more smoothly.
      EVP_Digest() takes one more parameter.
      make update
      One forgotten function.
      Make sure crypto/krb5/krb5_asn.h becomes part of libeay.num.
      Make sure crypto/krb5/krb5_asn.h is copied to the directory of     exported header files.
      make update
      The implementation of the TKTBODY ASN.1 functions was missing.
      Changes to the Kerberos SSL code by Jeffrey Altman &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">jaltman at columbia.edu</A>&gt;     His comments are:
      Code to avoid the use of non-standard strptime().  By     Jeffrey Altman &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">jaltman at columbia.edu</A>&gt;
      Changes to the Kerberos SSL code by Jeffrey Altman &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">jaltman at columbia.edu</A>&gt;     His comments are:
      Private functions do not belong in an exported header file, so move     them to one that won't get exported.
      Include kssl_lcl.h where needed.
      make update
      Document the recent Kerberos SSL changes.
      Some of the Kerberos code had dissapeared.  Reapply.
      Add the possibility to specify the use of zlib compression and     decompression.  It can be set up to link at link time or to load the     zlib library at run-time.
      Clarify that zlib-dynamic is the default choice.
      paddr may be NULL.  Do not crash if it is.
      Prevent KSSL server from requesting a client certificate.     Submitted by Jeffrey Altman &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">jaltman at columbia.edu</A>&gt;
      SSL_get_[rw]fd were documented but not implemented.
      SSL_get_rfc were documented but not implemented.
      More Kerberos SSL patches from Vern Staats &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">staatsvr at asc.hpc.mil</A>&gt;.     His comments are:
      Not all platforms have the OpenBSD crypto device.
      Addapt VMS script to the latest changes in the makefiles.
      make update
      More Kerberos SSL changes from Jeffrey Altman &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">jaltman at columbia.edu</A>&gt;     His comments are:
      Whoops, my fault, a backslash got converted to a slash...
      Correct most of the unsigned vs. signed warnings (or int vs. size_t),     and rename some local variables to avoid name shadowing.
      Make as sure as possible that gethostname() will be properly declared.
      Vade retro C++ comments!
      Make sure the source file is included among the dependencies.  This is     the norm for 'gcc -M' but not for 'makedepend', and is merely     introduced here to avoid commit wars.
      make update
      Make sure memcpy() gets properly declared by including string.h.
      Apply the Tru64 patch from Tim Mooney &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">mooney at dogbert.cc.ndsu.NoDak.edu</A>&gt;
      gcc 3.0 tells me that -m486 is deprecated.  The gcc 2.95 manual tells     me the same and that the correct option is -mcpu=i486.  I'm assuming     -mcpu has been around for some time, and that it's therefore safe to     change all occurences of -m486 to -mcpu=i486.
      Make sure evil file name characters, like spaces or ampersands (!),     don't disturb the rehashing process.     Spotted and suggested patch from Rudo Thomas &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">rudo at internet.sk</A>&gt;
      In case of memory problems, the va_start() wasn't cleaned with a va_end().     Noticed by Thomas Klausner &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">wiz at danbala.ifoer.tuwien.ac.at</A>&gt;.
      Two changes:
      The #error message must match a very specific regexp (see mkdef.pl,     currently line 470).
      'make update'
      Apparently, Linux is identified with __linux__ as well.
      Stop thinking arguments starting with - are algorithm identifiers.     Show timing parameters and timing functions used.     It looks like some Linuxen have very weird settings for CLK_TCK.  I'm     very unsure about this change and will investigate further.
      Synchronise with Unixly build.
      Change HZ in speed to rely on sysconf() if the clock tick is available     that way.  Synchronise s_time with these changes.
      o_time.c contains symbols with dollar signs in them, so we must tell     the compiler not to warn about that.
      Some new symbols have very long names...
      Addapt seldom compiled code to new semantics of the key schedule (not     a pointer any more).
      sk_ENGINE_CLEANUP_ITEM_pop_free() is duplicated in ENGINE_cleanup().     Let's use sk_ENGINE_CLEANUP_ITEM_pop_free() instead.
      'make update'
      Woopsie...
      Hmm, everything &quot;open&quot; isn't necessarely &quot;openssl&quot; :-).     *sigh* habit...
      A lot of things are undeclared unless x509.h is included.
      sch isn't an array, how did this pass through gcc?
      Because there's chances we clash with the system's types.h, rename our     types.h to ossl_typ.h.
      Because there's chances we clash with the system's types.h, rename our     types.h to ossl_typ.h.     Also, it seems like krb5 was forgotten in some places.
      Since ossl_typ.h is an exported header, we sure need to export it on     VMS as well :-).
      'make update'
      SSL_add_dir_cert_subjects_to_stack for Win32 finally implemented.     Submitted by Massimo Santin &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">msantin at santineassociati.com</A>&gt;.
      Typo...
      Copy evptests.txt to the right place.

      makedepend sometimes produces duplicates.  Remove them.
      To avoid commit wars over dependencies, let's make it so things that     depend on the environment, like the presence of the OpenBSD crypto     device or of Kerberos, do not change the dependencies within OpenSSL.
      'make update'
      It seems like gcc does canonicalisation of file names.  More     specifically, a starting './' is removed.  makedepend doesn't do this,     resulting in another possible commit war, so let's fix that by doing a     poor mans canonicalisation of file names that gives the same effect as     doing dependencies through gcc.
      'make update'
      For systems where gcc is used and where we don't know if GNU ld is     used or not, let's ask collect2 which ld it uses and choose to use the     target do-gnu_shared if GNU ld is used.
      Add support for md4WithRSAEncryption.
      'make update'
      In certain cases, no encoding has been set up for the b64 filter.  In     such cases, a flush should *not* attempt to finalise the encoding, as     the EVP_ENCODE_CTX structure will only be filled with garbage.  For     the same reason, do the same check when a wpending is performed.
      The EVP_*Init_ex() functions take one extra argument.  Let's default     it to NULL.
      Wrong place...

      make update
      Deprecate the macro MAC_OS_pre_X.
      Due to an increasing number of clashes between modern OpenSSL and     libdes (which is still used out there) or other des implementations,     the OpenSSL DES functions are renamed to begin with DES_ instead of     des_.  Compatibility routines are provided and declared by including     openssl/des_old.h.  Those declarations are the same as were in des.h     when the OpenSSL project started, which is exactly how libdes looked     at that time, and hopefully still looks today.
      A C file is a C file is a C file!
      Have the removal warnings very high up in the source.
      Remove DES_random_seed() but retain des_random_seed() for now.  Change     the docs to reflect this change and correct libeay.num.
      Make sure openssl speed is compilable on systems where fork() doesn't     exist.  For now, that's all the ones we &quot;support&quot; except Unix.
      Change the DES documentation to reflect the current status.  Note that     some password reading functions are really part of the UI     compatibility library...
      Correct some links...
      Addapt VMS scripts to the newer disk layout system ODS-5, which allows more than one period and mixed size characters in file names
      Change the shared library support so the shared libraries get built     sooner and the programs get built against the shared libraries.
      DOS and Windows do not like unistd.h
      No need to include anything on systems that do not have /dev/crypt
      Place the OpenSSL-specific headers back so they always get included,     or we get a dependency war in Makefile.ssl
      des_old.h doesn't really need to include des.h, so don't.  That will     avoid clashes with other code that have their own DES_ functions but     really only use OpenSSL's old des_ functions.
      Exclude .out files
      unsigned int vs. int.
      Remove temporary files
      Implement STARTTLS for certain protocols, currently only supporting SMTP.
      Change the order of events so the capabilities of loaded engines can     get listed as well.
      After loading a dynamic engine, reset the command definitions to the     empty set.  This prevents engines that do not set the command     definitions themselves to inherit the ones from &quot;dynamic&quot;, which would     otherwise be very confusing.
      Add a demo that reimplements the RSAref glue in form of a dynamically     loadable engine.
      In a Debian Linux environment, it's not a good idea, apparently, to     manually declare the include directory /usr/include at the same time     as the macro PROTOTYPES is defined with the value 1.  Besides,     /usr/include is the standard include directory anyway, so there's no     need to specify it explicitely.
      Make use of RSAref's header files instead of EAY's crafted rsaref.h.
      make update     perl util/mkerr.pl -recurse -write -rebuild
      Make it possible to build completely static, independent error C     files.
      Add a local error code configuration file for the rsaref dynamic     engine.
      Add targets to update the error code files.
      'make update' + some touches.
      Use the generated error code files.
      At least for the two common Unixly DSO loading methods, include the     system error in the error text.
      If an engine isn't built in, try loading it as a shareable library     instead.  This also makes it possible for users to simply give said     shareable library as argument for the -engine option.
      Add DES functions.     Restructure the code and comment it a bit.     Prepare for the presence of digests.
      Make it possible to give digest names as -evp arguments.
      Add MD digests.
      make update
      A missing comma added.
      Make sure evp_locl.h can be included (hw_openbsd_dev_crypto.c needs that).
      On systems that don't do too well including headers from a different     directory, trust the building scripts to handle it properly.
      End assembler macro correctly.
      Build dynamic rsaref engine on VMS.  Tested on VAX so far.
      On VMS, the norm is still that symbols are uppercased, so for now it's better      to trust that norm.  I might implement a control for this later on
      Extentions of the explanations to the linking problem on Win32.  Provided by Andrew Gray &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">agray at iconsinc.com</A>&gt;
      Certain missing algorithms make some SSL versions or TLS impossible to     build.
      I was recently informed that some people wrongly use ssleay.txt as     main documentation, so let's warn them a little more, so the word     &quot;OBSOLETE&quot; really gets understood.
      UID was never a lable for uniqueIdentifier.  However, LDAP and certain     RFCs concerning X.500 directories use UID as a shorter name for the     attribute type userId, which is defined by CCITT and available through     RFCs 1274 and 2247.

      Implement failover for ubsec.  Submitted by Subramanian Ramamoorthy     &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">sram at broadcom.com</A>&gt; with the following comment:
      Change pkcs12 so the certificates coming from -in do not get tossed if     -certfile is given as well.
      Synchronise with the 0.9.6 branch.
      Do not forget to compile comp_err.c
      Better use the same number in all branches, to avoid confusion
      And just for the sake of completeness, let's add some standard macros...
      Status update

      On Solaris64, cc needs the flag -xarch=v9 when linking shared     libraries.  Make a general change to support shared library     linking flags in general.     Noted by Nick Briggs &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">briggs at parc.xerox.com</A>&gt;
      Allow 8-bit characters.  This is not really complete, it only marks     characters with the highest bit set as HIGHBIT.  We need to expand     this to support the UTF-8 character set properly.  However, this     solves the problem that the character 0x80 (which is common in UTF-8)     gets masked to 0x00.

      When RSA or DSA are disabled, do not include the stuff that's specific     to them.
      The block size may be something other than 8!
      Because Rijndael is more known as AES, use crypto/aes instead of     crypto/rijndael.  Additionally, I applied the AES integration patch     from Stephen Sprunk &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">stephen at sprunk.org</A>&gt; and fiddled it to work     properly with the normal EVP constructs (and incidently work the same     way as all other symmetric cipher implementations).
      Implement speed measurement for AES.     Submitted by Stephen Sprunk &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">stephen at sprunk.org</A>&gt; as part of his AES     integration patch.

      Bring VMS up to date with development.
      Add more of the NIST test vectors for AES.
      Use FIPS-197 vectors for AES.  The NIST vectors were constructed by     reencrypting or redecrypting the ciphertext 10000 times, which of     course gives higly different results.
      To avoid all kinds of link-level clashes, rename all old des_*     functions to _old_des_*.
      To avoid all kinds of link-level clashes, rename all old des_*     functions to _old_des_*.
      Because of recent changes, there's no need to hack the des symbols any     more.
      make update     libeay.num got tweaked so the old des symbols would retain their     positions.
      Keep the NIST AES vectors that were there previously.
      There is no aestest currently.  The EVP tester is used to check the     AES algorithm.
      Add -keyform.  Document -engine.
      Document the change in rsautl.

      I got a request to make the &quot;old des&quot; symbols more closely tied to     OpenSSL.  Adding '_ossl' in the name seems to be a good way to do     this.
      Add old patch from Robert Dahlem &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">Robert.Dahlem at ffm2.siemens.de</A>&gt; to     make it possible to produce shared libraries on ReliantUNIX.

      With the changed des_old API, let's complete the work by renaming the     functions in ui_compat.  This gave reason to rework that part more     thoroughly, so here are the changes made:
      'make update'
      If the intended header file doesn't exist, create it.
      Generate the individual engines' error strings and macros     automatically.
      Certain reasons aren't really part of the engine framework, so let's     make them ubsec-specific in the ubsec implementation.
      Add aep and sureware implementations and clean up some error reasons     that were never part of the engine framework.
      Because AEP and we used the same AEP_R_ prefix for error reasons,     lets change our prefix to AEPHK_R_.  Otherwise, we get very mysterious     errors because we happen to redefine AEP_R_OK and AEP_R_GENERAL_ERROR.
      I forgot to include the aep and sureware vendor header files.
      Oops, do not unlock CRYPTO_LOCK_DYNLOCK when we locked     CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND...
      Remove an unused variable.
      Add notes on the added support for aep and sureware crypto cards in     0.9.7.
      Make link-shard a little bit more efficient.  If there are no     extensions to link together, there's no point looping at all.
      Move teh silencer to the right place.
      Update the configuration of CygWin32 to use the new capabilities of     CygWin 1.3.x, which includes thread and shared library support.
      Modify the main trunk version to 0.9.8-dev.     0.9.7 now lives in the branch OpenSSL_0_9_7-stable.
      Correct sh, please
      At Corinna Vinschen's request, change CygWin32 to Cygwin
      The Cygwin shared extension was shifted.
      make update, with libeay.num remade to match the 0.9.7-stable one.
      For some reason, getting the topmost error was done the same way as     getting the bottommost one.  I hope I understood correctly how this     should be done.  It seems to work when running evp_test in an     environment where it can't find openssl.cnf.
      Make sure memset() is defined by including string.h     Notified by Oscar Jacobsson &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">oscar at jacobsson.org</A>&gt;

      gcc chokes on C++ comments in C code.
      Missing #endif
      Local `time' shadows the global function `time()'.  Rename the local     variable to `tim' (and, as a matter of consequence, `time_d' to `tim_d').
      The macro IMPLEMENT_ASN1_FUNCTIONS_const already contains an ending ;,     so do not add one after the expansion, since ANSI C doesn't allow ;;     at this level (or at least, so tells me gcc).
      Adjust the NID names for the AES modes OFB and CFB to contain the number     of feedback bits
      Add the modes OFB128, CFB128 and CTR128 to AES.     Submitted by Stephen Sprunk &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">stephen at sprunk.org</A>&gt;
      The AES modes OFB and CFB are defined with 128 feedback bits.  This     deviates from the &quot;standard&quot; 64 bits of feedback that all other     algorithms are using.  Therefore, let's redo certain EVP macros to     accept different amounts of feedback bits for these modes.
      Since Cygwin is the proper spelling, let's change to that everywhere.     Also, with the change in Configure, it now knows on it's own if     threads are supported or not.
      Oh, and since config figures out that we run Cygwin and what versions,     let's recommend running config instead of a manual Configure.
      Don't shadow already defined variables
      With Compaq make, it seems like # inside an action becomes part of the command, not a comment at all
      Comparing a pointer (data) with 0 using &gt; is incorrect.  The changed     comparison doesn't look right, but at least it compiles.  It would be nice     if the one who knows what this is supposed to do changed it to do it correctly
      Instead of just checking for OpenVMS, check if DEC C is used, since it's as     picky on all platforms
      With Compaq make, it seems like # inside an action becomes part of the command, not a comment at all

      A number of includes were removed from evp.h some time ago.  The reason     was that they weren't really needed any more for EVP itself.  However,     it seems like soma applications (I know about OpenSSH, but there may     be more) used evp.h as the 'load all' header file, which makes sense     since we try our best to promote the use of EVP instead of the lower     level crypto algorithms.  Therefore, I put the inclusions back so     the application authors don't get too shocked by all the errors they     would otherwise get.

      For those wanting to build for several platforms with the same source     directory, making a separate directory tree with lots of symbolic links     seems to be the solution.

Now I just have to     find all other places where there's lack of support for this.

      isalist was less trustable than I thought (or rather, one can trust it to     come up with all kinds of names we don't have in our targets).     Besides, our sparcv9 targets currently generate sparcv8 code, I'm told.
      So, I discovered that if you have your $PATH set so a ld different from     GNU ld comes first, checking the usage of collect2 gives that instead of     GNU ld, even if GNU ld would be the one that would get used if we link using     gcc.  It's much better, apparently, to ask gcc directly what the path to     GNU ld is (provided it's there at all and gcc knows about it), and ask     the result if it's a GNU or not.  The bonus is that our GNU ld detection     mechanism got shorter and easier to understand...

      Step 2 of move of engines: copy engines to new directory and rename them     to be prefixed with e_ instead of hw_.  They aren't necessarely hardware     engines.  The files commited here are exact copies of the corresponding     hw_ files found in crypto/engine/.
      Step 3 of move of engines: copy the corresponding vendor header files.
      Step 4 of move of engines: Split e.ec into individual files for each     engine.
      Step 5 of move of engines: Add a makefile (and a .cvsignore).
      That wasn't supposed to be there...
      Step 6 of move of engines: rename the macro ENGINE_DYNAMIC_SUPPORT to     OPENSSL_NO_DYNAMIC_ENGINE and make sure that gets defined unless     shared library support has been specifically requested.
      Typo.
      Step 7 of move of engines: Engines should not depend on private     OpenSSL header files.
      We didn't copy the cryptodev engine here, darn it!
      Step 8 of move of engines: Remove the last little quirks.     DECIMAL_SIZE is copied from crypto/cryptlib.h.
      Typo
      Step 9 of move of engines: rename crypto/engine/hw_cryptodev.c to     eng_cryptodev.c.  This is an engine that (at least currently) has     to be built in.
      Step 10 of move of engines: Change crypto/engine/Makefile.ssl so we     don't build any &quot;built-in&quot; engines in that directory any more, except     fo the cryptodev one.
      Step 11a of move of engines: Time to make the changes to support     automatic load of dynamic engines.  Unless we don't have shared     library support, do not try to load any &quot;built-in&quot; engines except for     cryptodev.
      Step 11b of move of engines: Time to make the changes to support     automatic load of dynamic engines.  Add functionality to the dynamic     engine to handle engine directories and loading from those.  This     is currently NOT compatible with the use of LD_LIBRARY_PATH and     similar environment variables.
      Step 11c of move of engines: Time to make the changes to support     automatic load of dynamic engines.  Change the iterator to try to load     the requested engine dynamically.  The environment variable     OPENSSL_ENGINES can be used to override the internal default directory     where one can expect to find dynamically loadable engines.
      Step 12 of move of engines: Time to make the changes to support     automatic load of dynamic engines.  Make the changes in the main     Makefile so the engines are built, but now in the engines/ directory.
      Step 13 of move of engines:  Remove old files.

      Remove unused code, don't use zlib functions that are really macros     and provide missing prototypes.
      Setting the ex_data index is unsafe in a threaded environment, so     let's wrap it with a lock.
      Make sure int SSL_COMP_add_compression_method() checks if a certain     compression identity is already present among the registered     compression methods, and if so, reject the addition request.
      Add functionality to get information on compression methods (not quite complete).

      The object file is o_str.o, not o_str.c.
      Correct serious bug in AES-CBC decryption when the message length isn't     a multiple of AES_BLOCK_SIZE.     Optimize decryption of all complete blocks in AES-CBC by removing an     unnecessary memcpy().
      Removing those memcpy()s also took away the possibility for in and out to     be the same.  Therefore, the removed memcpy()s need to be restored.
      Let exit codes propagate from within for loops.
      Engines are usually binary, and should therefore be in INSTALLTOP     rather than OPENSSLDIR.

      Move do_subject() to apps.c and rename it to parse_name().  The     rationale behind the move is that it's use by several applications.     The rationale behind the name change is that it describes what the     function does a bit better.

      Damnit, I'm sick of having to do something special every time a module     that gets built before objects barfs all over the place because it     uses a new NID that hasn't had a chance of getting defined yet (in     this case, it was about a couple of new EC curves, and therefore a     couple of new corresponding NIDs).

      Adding a slash between the directoryt and the file is a problem with     VMS.  The C RTL can handle it well if the &quot;directory&quot; is a logical     name with no colon, therefore ending being 'logname/file'.  However,     if the given logical names actually has a colon, or if you use a full     VMS-syntax directory, you end up with 'logname:/file' or     'dev:[dir1.dir2]/file', and that isn't handled in any good way.

      Basically, I wanted to be able to make a dump to a FILE*, and not have     to bother creating a BIO around it.  So here's a few more functions to     make it possible to make the dump using a printing callback, and to     print to a FILE* (based on the callback variant), done in the same     style as the functions in crypto/err/err_prn.c.
      On systems that use case-insensitive symbol names (i.e. they're all     converted to upper case or something like that), the application-     level bio_dump_cb() has a name clash with the new library function     BIO_dump_cb().  The easiest fix is to rename the function at the     application level.

      Because libraries on Windows lack useful version information, the zlib     guys had to change the name to differentiate with older versions when     a backward incompatibility came up.  Of course, we need to adapt.     This change simply tries to load the library through the newer name     (ZLIB1) first, and if that fails, it tries the good old ZLIB.

      Because -rpath/-R may have been used, our settings of LD_LIBRARY_PATH     and friends may be entirely useless.  In such a case, LD_PRELOAD is     the answer, at least on platforms using LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  There might     be other variables to set on other platforms, please fill us in...
      Don't use $(EXHEADER) directly in for loops, as most shells will break     if $(EXHEADER) is empty.
      Make sure LD_PRELOAD is only set when we build shared libraries (and     therefore link with them).  Add LD_PRELOAD setting code where it was     still missing.
      Some find it confusing that environment variables are set when shared     libraries aren't built or used.  I can see the point, so I'm     reorganising a little for clarity.
      Whoops, syntactic mistake...
      Cut'n'paste mistake.  All tested OK now...
      Make an explicit check during certificate validation to see that the     CA setting in each certificate on the chain is correct.  As a side-     effect always do the following basic checks on extensions, not just     when there's an associated purpose to the check:     - if there is an unhandled critical extension (unless the user has       chosen to ignore this fault)     - if the path length has been exceeded (if one is set at all)     - that certain extensions fit the associated purpose (if one has been       given)
      Document the change.
      Split X509_check_ca() into a small self and an internal function     check_ca(), to resolve constness issue.  check_ca() is called from the     purpose checkers instead of X509_check_ca(), since the stuff done by     the latter (except for calling check_ca()) is also done by     X509_check_purpose().

      Changes concering RFC 3820 (proxy certificates) integration:
      Small thing.  It seems like we have to defined _XOPEN_SOURCE to get     isascii() on DEC/Compaq/HP C for VMS.
      Apparently, at least with my VMS C environment, defining _XOPEN_SOURCE     gets _POSIX_C_SOURC and _ANSI_C_SOURCE defined, which stops u_int from     being defined, and that breaks havock into the rest of the standard     headers...  *sigh*
      The mix of CFLAGS and LDFLAGS is a bit confusing in my opinion, and     Makefile.shared was a bit overcomplicated.

      From branch OpenSSL_0_9_7-stable, 2004-09-11 11:45:
      Some true positives fixed, toss some false positives.
      A few more fingerprints...
      Actually, C on VMS/Alpha knows very well what a long long is, and     knows how to make use of it.  So let's stop pretending the Alpha     doesn't know long long...
      Since BN_LLONG will only be defined for Alpha/VMS and not VAX/VMS,     there's no need to undefine it here.  Then, let's get a bit paranoid     and not define BN_ULLONG on THIRTY_TWO_BIT machines when BN_LLONG     isn't defined.
      I was incorrect about VMS/Alpha.  Defining BN_LLONG with     SIXTY_FOUR_BIT could cause havoc, so don't (it's lucky bn.h undefines     BN_LLONG when SIXTY_FOUR_BIT is defined).
      I just branched 0.9.8, so HEAD needs to be bumped to 0.9.9-dev.
      Version changes where needed.
      Update status information
      Patches for Cygwin, provided by Corinna Vinschen &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">vinschen at redhat.com</A>&gt;
      When _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined, make sure it's defined to 500.  Required in     <A HREF="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/compilation.html.">http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/compilation.html.</A>
      DEC C complains about bad subscript, but we know better, so let's shut it up.
      Typo correction
      It seems like mkdef.pl couldn't quite understand that #ifdef OPENSSL_NO_SHA512     was still active when it came down to the functions.  mkdef.pl should really     be corrected, but that'll be another day...
      Typo
      We have some source with \r\n as line ends.  DEC C informs about that,     and I really can't be bothered...
      Change all relevant occurences of 'ncipher' to 'chil'.  That's what nCipher always wanted...
      Synchronise with Unixly build
      pqueue and dtls uses 64-bit values.  Unfortunately, OpenSSL doesn't     have a uniform representation for those over all architectures, so a     little bit of hackery is needed.
      DJGPP changes.  Contributed by Doug Kaufman &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">dkaufman at rahul.net</A>&gt;
      Merge in the new news from 0.9.8-stable.
      Merge from 0.9.8-stable.
      Synchronise more with the Unix build.
      Synchronise yet a little more with the Unixly build
      From 0.9.8-stable:
      The macro THREADS was changed to OPENSSL_THREADS a long time ago.
      Updated support for NetWare, submitted by Verdon Walker &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">VWalker at novell.com</A>&gt;.
      Old typo...
      Add support for the new Intel compiler, icc.     Submitted by Keith Thompson &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">kst at sdsc.edu</A>&gt;
      Correct typo ia64.o -&gt; bn-ia64.o.
      gcc 2.95.3 on Ultrix supports long long.
      Change pq_compat.h to trust the macros defined by bn.h a bit more, and thereby     provide better generic support for environments that do not have 64-bit     integers.  Among others, this should solve PR 1086
      Remove the incorrect installation of '%{openssldir}/lib'.
      Document the change and update the version number (d'oh!).
      Further change pq_compat.h to generate the flag macros PQ_64BIT_IS_INTEGER     and PQ_64BIT_IS_BIGNUM with the values 0 (for false) and 1 (for true),     depending on which is true.  Use those flags everywhere else to provide     the correct implementation for handling certain operations in q PQ_64BIT.
      Update from 0.9.8-stable.
      _GNU_SOURCE needs to be defined before any standard header.
      Skipping all tests just because one algorithm is disabled seems a bit harsch.
      Pass INSTALL_PREFIX in BUILDENV.
      Avoid endless loops.  Really, we were using the same variable for two     different conditions...
      When the return type of the function is int, it's better to return an     in than NULL, especially when an error is signalled with a negative     value.
      Show what the offending target was.
      Netware patch submitted by Verdon Walker&quot; &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">VWalker at novell.com</A>&gt; in PR     1107.  He says:
      Status update
      0.9.8-beta5 works on VMS/Alpha
      0.9.8-beta5 works on Cygwin
      0.9.8-beta5 works on SuSE 9.3
      Data about which Cygwin versions 0.9.8-beta5 work on
      0.9.8-beta5 works on Gentoo/arml but not /armb, and works on Linux AMD64
      Do not undefine _XOPEN_SOURCE.  This is currently experimental, and     will be firmed up as soon as it's been verified not to break anything.
      Have pod2man.pl accept '=for comment ...' before the '=head1 NAME' line.
      Only define ZLIB_SHARED if it hasn't already been defined (on the command     line, for example).
      Move the definition of DEVRANDOM for DJGPP from Configure to e_os.h.     That should solve the issues with propagating it through the Makefiles.
      Add better documentation on how id_function() should be defined and what     issues there are.
      Undefine DECRANDOM before redefining it.
      With DJGPP, it seems like the return code from grep, even when in the     middle of a pipe, is noted.  Counter that by forcing a true return code     when the return code has no importance.
      Add crypto/bn/bn_prime.h to the collection of generated files.  In the     update target, place the dependency on depend last, so all necessary files     are generated *before* the dependencies are figured out.
      Check for 'usage' and 'Usage'.     Submitted by Tim Rice &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">tim at multitalents.net</A>&gt;.  His comment is:
      Do no try to pretend we're at the end of anything unless we're at the end     of a 4-character block.
      Strip the engine shared libraries as well.
      Change dir_ctrl to check for the environment variable before using the default     directory instead of the other way around.
      Configure update for Stratus VOS.
      Update for Stratus VOS.
      DCC doesn't like argument names in returned function pointers.
      The NAME section of a man page is required to have a dash followed by a     short description, at least according to pod2man.
      Initialise dir to avoid a compiler warning.
      Do not defined des_crypt(), since it clashes with Solaris crypt.h.
      Wrap the inclusion of openssl/engine.h with a protective check for     the absence of OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE.
      Wrap the inclusion of openssl/engine.h with a protective check for     the absence of OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE.
      Someone did some cutting and pasting and didn't quite finish the job :-).
      Updated status from 0.9.8-stable.
      There are a few showstoppers.  Unfortunately, I only remember one.  Please fill this in.
      asn1parse doesn't support any TXT format, so let's stop pretending     it does.
      Actually, the 64bit format specifier differs between SIXTY_FOUR_BIT and     SIXTY_FOUR_BIT_LONG
      The private key should never have ended up in newreq.pem.     Now, it ends up in newkey.pem instead.
      Add libcrypto.pc and libssl.pc, and install them along with openssl.pc.
      Changes from the 0.9.8 branch.
      Changes from the 0.9.8 branch.
      On case insensitive systems, 'install' gets mixed up with the existing file     'INSTALL', so we need to put some force into installing
      I'm reversing this change, as it seems the error is somewhere else.
      bytes_to_long_long isn't used anywhere any more, so let's remove it     entirely.
      Synchronise with Unix changes.
      More synchronisation with the Unixly build.
      Last synchronisationn with Unixly build.  I hope...
      Synchronise with Unixly build.
      Synchronise VMS build with Unixly build.
      Remove warnings about signed vs. unsigned...
      Change a comment so it corresponds to reality.  Put back a character that     was previously replaced with a NUL for parsing purposes.  This seems to     fix a very weird parsing bug involving two variable references in the same     value.
      Renumber to follow what happens with 0.9.8.
      Add in CHANGES for 0.9.7i.
      A slight change in documentation that makes it so much more comprehensible
      Fix numerous bugs in the Win32 path splitter
      Document it
      Synchronise with the Unix build.
      When using POSIXly functions, we need to define _POSIX_C_SOURCE, at     least when the source is compiled with ANSI settings.
      Build Whirlpool on VMS as well
      Whirlpool was added to EVP, so let's build it on VMS as well.
      wq instead of wp?  That's gotta be among the more amazing typos I've     made...
      Whoops, we were copying instead of comparing at the end of trying to     find a queue element.
      Missing files in the VMS installation
      Fix signed/unsigned char clashes.
      The VMS I run on doesn't know socklen_t and uses size_t instead.
      Disable the Mixed Linkage warning for some selected modules.  This is     because the Compaq C compiler will not accept that a variable be     declared extern then defined static without a warning.
      Typo...
      Forgot to initialize CC6DISABLEWARNINGS properly...
      signed vs. unsigned clash.
      As an effect of revisions 1.261, BUILD_CMD was changed so $(DIRS)     wasn't respected when using it to build different parts of OpenSSL.     1.269 was an attempt to correct that, but unfortunately meant that we     built every part that was given i $(DIRS) 7 times.  This change puts     back the original intent with BUILD_CMD via the new macro     BUILD_ONE_CMD while keeping the intent with RECURSIVE_BUILD_CMD.
      Document the building macros.
      Break out deltree in its' own command procedure.
      Add TS to the VMS build.
      Add a TSA test.  testtsa.com is a manual sh to dcl translation of     testtsa.
      Synchronise with openss.cnf
      Forgot the TSA application...
      Make shorter TS symbols for OpenVMS.     Don't convert a function pointer to a void*, ISO C doesn't like that.
      The actual whirlpool test was missing on VMS...
      Remember to *build* WP_TEST on VMS, as well :-)
      Resolve signed vs. unsigned issues
      Oh, now I noticed Bodo's change that made tlsext_ecpointformatlist     unsigned...
      tlsext_ecpointformatlist_length is unsigned, so check if it's less     than zero will only result in pissing of some compilers...
      Typo...
      Synchronise with recent changes
      VMS doesn't support includes of paths very well.
      Keep up with the changes in the Unix build system.
      Only try to remove the tsa.dir subdirectory if it actually exists.
      Since we're moving between directories, let's get an absolute path to     openssl.exe.
      Small bug.  apps/CA.sh and apps/CA.com look at SSLEAY_CONFIG, not     OPENSSL_CONF.
      The -config option flag needs to be in the SSLEAY_CONFIG value.
      Synchronise with recent changes
      If we declare a function, like d2i_TS_MSG_IMPRINT_bio(), we'd better     *define* it too, or things like shared libraries might be a bit sad.
      Change chop to chomp when reading lines, so CRLF is properly processed on     the operating systems where they are the normal line endings
      Synchronise with the Unix build
      Synchronise what what's happening with the Unix build
      Got sick and tired of duplicating...  Too error-prone (i.e. I forget     to update both...)!
      Synchronise
      Synchronise with Unixly build.     (Geez, a lot is happening right now, eh? :-))
      Make sure obj_xref.h is updated during a &quot;make update&quot;
      Someone made a mistake, and some function and reason codes got     duplicate numbers.  Renumbering.
      make update
      Keep in sync with Unix
      There was a problem with too long command lines, so I rebuilt to make     it work better.
      Signed vs. unsigned conflict
      rslen is unsigned, so it can never go below 0.
      Deal with another name that's longer than 31 characters.
      Use a new signed int ii instead of j (which is unsigned) to handle the     return value from sk_SSL_CIPHER_find().
      Because all object files are now in a file, we don't need to mention     any of them on the linker command line.  Besides, OBJECT_FILE now     represents the last compiled file, and using it here only results in     getting warnings about multiple definitions of the symbols in that     file.
      Synchronise with the Unixly build.
      Synchronise with Unix
      A few more ENGINE strings that need shortening.
      Keep synchronised with the Unix build
      Keep synchronised with Unix
      Use poll() when possible to gather Unix randomness entropy
      Correct warnings about signedness.
      According to documentation, including time.h declares select() on     OpenVMS, and possibly more.
      Complete the change for VMS.
      Fixes for the following claims:
      Synchronise with Unixly build
      Synchronise with Unixly build, again ;-)
      Replace strdup() with BUF_strdup().
      Needed definition of _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED so DEC C on VMS will see     the declarations of fd_set, select() and so on.
      Synchronise a bit more with Unixly build
      After objects have been freed, NULLify the pointers so there will be no double     free of those objects

      Synchronise the VMS build with recent movements in the Unix build.
      Apply a more modern way to get the definition of select(), except for VMS.     Submitted by Corinna Vinschen &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">vinschen at redhat.com</A>&gt;
      Synchronise VMS with Unix.
      VAX C can't handle 64 bit integers, making SHA512 impossible...
      Change submitted by Doug Kaufman.  He writes:
      Synchronise with Unix build
      Provide other forms for symbols that are too long or that clash with others
      Further synchronisation with Unix build.  I hadn't noticed pq_compat.h     was gone...

      Do the Camellia part right
      Hopefully resolve signed vs unsigned issue.
      Because DEC C - sorry, HP C - is picky about features, we need to     define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED to reach fd_set and timeval types and     functionality.
      Data not initialised.     Notified by Gerardo Ganis &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">gerardo.ganis at cern.ch</A>&gt;
      Reference bug.
      Make it possible to disable STORE.
      Make STORE an experimental feature.
      A DTLS1 symbol needs to be chopped off a bit.
      Include sys/time.h to declare gettimeofday().
      Cast to avoid signedness confusion
      Add local symbol hacks for OpenVMS
      Add padlock data     Redo the loop so it really compiles all objects for one engine, then     links the engine (until now, it still thought every file was an engine     of its own...).
      Stupid typo
      Reimplement time check for VMS to mimic the way it's done on Windows.     Reason: gettimeofday() is deprecated.
      Make the NULL definition of OPENSSL_ia32cap_loc() compatible with the     declaration in crypto.h.
      Move the time fetching code to its own static function, and thereby     make sure that BOTH instances of said code get the VMS modification.
      Synchronise VMS with Unixly build.
      Make sure the padlock code compiles correctly even on hardware that     doesn't have padlocks.
      Do not try to link the support file(s), as they aren't a complete     engine ;-)
      Forgotten comma...
      Add a comment about libeay.num and ssleay.num
      Have mkdef.pl also handle VAX and Non-VAX differences for VMS
      Functional VMS changes submitted by <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">sms at antinode.info</A> (Steven M. Schweda).     Thank you\!     (note: not tested for now, a few nightly builds should give indications though)

      size_t doesn't compare less than zero...
      Apparently, test/testtsa.com was only half done
      Have the VMS build system catch up with the 1.0.0-stable branch.
      If opensslconf.h and buildinf.h are to be in an architecture specific     directory, place it in the same tree as the other architecture     specific things.
      Architecture specific header files need special handling.
      The previous take went wrong, try again.
      Typo.
      We redid the structure on architecture dependent source files, but     apparently forgot to adapt the copying to the installation directory.

      Taken from OpenSSL_1_0_0-stable:
      Synchronise with Unix and do all other needed modifications to have it     build on VMS again.
      Better way to build tests.  Taken from OpenSSL-1_0_1-stable
      * tests.com: Add the symbol openssl_conf, so the openssl application       stops complaining about a missing configuration file.  Define the logical       name PERL_ENV_TABLES with values to Perl considers the DCL symbol table       as part of the environment (see 'man perlvms' for details), so cms-test.pl       can get the value of EXE_DIR from tests.com, among others.     * cms-test.pl: Make changes to have it work on VMS as well.  Upper or mixed       case options need to be quoted and the openssl command needs a VMS-specific       treatment.  It all should work properly on Unix, I hope it does on Windows       as well...
      Don't define an empty CFLAGS, it's much more honest not to defined it at all.     Make sure to remove any [.CRYTO]BUILDINF.H so it doesn't get used instead of     [.''ARCH'.CRYPTO]BUILDINF.H
      Give the architecture dependent directory higher priority
      Print openssl version information at the end of the tests
      Implement bc test strategy as submitted by Steven M. Schweda &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">sms at antinode.info</A>&gt;.     Make sure we move to '__here' before trying to use it to build local sslroot:
      Use the same directory for architecture dependent header files as in     the branches OpenSSL-1_0_0-stable and OpenSSL-1_0_1-stable.
      Better method for creating SSLROOT:.     Make sure to include the path to evptest.txt.

      Add missing source.  Also, have the compile also use [.MODES] as     include directory, as other parts (notably, EVP) seem to need it.
      A few more long symbols need shortening.
      * apps/openssl.c: For VMS, take care of copying argv if needed much earlier,       directly in main().  'if needed' also includes when argv is a 32 bit       pointer in an otherwise 64 bit environment.     * apps/makeapps.com: When using /POINTER_SIZE=64, try to use the additional       =ARGV, but only if it's supported.  Fortunately, DCL is very helpful       telling us in this case.
      * apps/makeapps.com: Forgot to end the check for /POINTER_SIZE=64=ARGV       with turning trapping back on.     * test/maketests.com: Do the same check for /POINTER_SIZE=64=ARGV       here.     * test/clean-test.com: A new script for cleaning up.
      * apps/makeapps.com: Add srp.
      * util/mkdef.pl: Add crypto/o_str.h and crypto/o_time.h.  Maybe some       more need to be added...
      * crypto/crypto-lib.com: Add a few more missing modules.

      Implement FIPS CMAC.
      make update
      * Makefile.fips: Update and add details about cmac.
      * fips/cmac/fips_cmactest.c: Changed to accept all the ciphers we       support (Two Key TDEA is not supported), to handle really big       messages (some of the test vectors have messages 65536 bytes long),       and to handle cases where there are several keys (Three Key TDEA)
      * fips/cmac/fips_cmactest.c: Some say TDEA, others say TDES.  Support       both names.
      * fips/fipsalgtest.pl: Test the testvectors for all the CMAC ciphers       we support.
      * fips/cmac/fips_cmac_selftest.c: Because the examples in SP_800-38B       aren't trustworthy (see examples 13 and 14, they have the same mac,       as do examples 17 and 18), use examples from official test vectors       instead.
      * Configure, crypto/ec/ec.h, crypto/ec/ecp_nistp224.c, util/mkdef.pl:       Have EC_NISTP224_64_GCC_128 treated like any algorithm, and have       disabled by default.  If we don't do it this way, it screws up       libeay.num.     * util/libeay.num: make update
