    Align documentation with recommendations of Linux Documentation Project
    
    This change applies the recommendation of the Linux Documentation Project
    to the documentation files of OpenSSL. Additionally, util/find-doc-nits
    was updated accordingly.
    
    The change follows a suggestion of mspncp on <A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/12370">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/12370</A>
    and incoporates the requested changes on the pull request
