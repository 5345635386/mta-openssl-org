- This document describes the way to add custom modifications to OpenSSL sources.
-
- If you are adding new public functions to the custom library build, you need to
- either add a prototype in one of the existing OpenSSL header files;
- or provide a new header file and edit Configurations/unix-Makefile.tmpl to pick up that file.
-
- After that perform the following steps:
-
-    ./Configure -Werror --strict-warnings [your-options]
-    make update
-    make
-    make test
-
- &quot;make update&quot; ensures that your functions declarations are added to util/libcrypto.num or util/libssl.num
- If you plan to submit the changes you made to OpenSSL (see CONTRIBUTING), it's worth running:
-
-    make doc-nits
-
- after running &quot;make update&quot; to ensure that documentation has correct format.
-
- &quot;make update&quot; also generates files related to OIDs (in the crypto/objects/ folder) and errors.
- If a merge error occurs in one of these generated files then the generated files need to be removed
- and regenerated using &quot;make update&quot;.
- To aid in this process the generated files can be committed separately so they can be removed easily.

+ENGINES
+=======
+
+  With OpenSSL 0.9.6, a new component was added to support alternative
+  cryptography implementations, most commonly for interfacing with external
+  crypto devices (eg. accelerator cards). This component is called ENGINE,
+  and its presence in OpenSSL 0.9.6 (and subsequent bug-fix releases)
+  caused a little confusion as 0.9.6** releases were rolled in two
+  versions, a &quot;standard&quot; and an &quot;engine&quot; version. In development for 0.9.7,
+  the ENGINE code has been merged into the main branch and will be present
+  in the standard releases from 0.9.7 forwards.
+
+  There are currently built-in ENGINE implementations for the following
+  crypto devices:
+
+  * Microsoft CryptoAPI
+  * VIA Padlock
+  * nCipher CHIL
+
+  In addition, dynamic binding to external ENGINE implementations is now
+  provided by a special ENGINE called &quot;dynamic&quot;. See the &quot;DYNAMIC ENGINE&quot;
+  section below for details.
+
+  At this stage, a number of things are still needed and are being worked on:
+
+  1. Integration of EVP support.
+  2. Configuration support.
+  3. Documentation!
+
+  Integration of EVP support
+  --------------------------
+
+  With respect to EVP, this relates to support for ciphers and digests in
+  the ENGINE model so that alternative implementations of existing
+  algorithms/modes (or previously unimplemented ones) can be provided by
+  ENGINE implementations.
+
+  Configuration support
+  ---------------------
+
+  Configuration support currently exists in the ENGINE API itself, in the
+  form of &quot;control commands&quot;. These allow an application to expose to the
+  user/admin the set of commands and parameter types a given ENGINE
+  implementation supports, and for an application to directly feed string
+  based input to those ENGINEs, in the form of name-value pairs. This is an
+  extensible way for ENGINEs to define their own &quot;configuration&quot; mechanisms
+  that are specific to a given ENGINE (eg. for a particular hardware
+  device) but that should be consistent across *all* OpenSSL-based
+  applications when they use that ENGINE. Work is in progress (or at least
+  in planning) for supporting these control commands from the CONF (or
+  NCONF) code so that applications using OpenSSL's existing configuration
+  file format can have ENGINE settings specified in much the same way.
+  Presently however, applications must use the ENGINE API itself to provide
+  such functionality. To see first hand the types of commands available
+  with the various compiled-in ENGINEs (see further down for dynamic
+  ENGINEs), use the &quot;engine&quot; openssl utility with full verbosity, i.e.:
+
+       openssl engine -vvvv
+
+  Documentation
+  -------------
+
+  Documentation? Volunteers welcome! The source code is reasonably well
+  self-documenting, but some summaries and usage instructions are needed -
+  moreover, they are needed in the same POD format the existing OpenSSL
+  documentation is provided in. Any complete or incomplete contributions
+  would help make this happen.
+
+  STABILITY &amp; BUG-REPORTS
+  =======================
+
+  What already exists is fairly stable as far as it has been tested, but
+  the test base has been a bit small most of the time. For the most part,
+  the vendors of the devices these ENGINEs support have contributed to the
+  development and/or testing of the implementations, and *usually* (with no
+  guarantees) have experience in using the ENGINE support to drive their
+  devices from common OpenSSL-based applications. Bugs and/or inexplicable
+  behaviour in using a specific ENGINE implementation should be sent to the
+  author of that implementation (if it is mentioned in the corresponding C
+  file), and in the case of implementations for commercial hardware
+  devices, also through whatever vendor support channels are available.  If
+  none of this is possible, or the problem seems to be something about the
+  ENGINE API itself (ie. not necessarily specific to a particular ENGINE
+  implementation) then you should mail complete details to the relevant
+  OpenSSL mailing list. For a definition of &quot;complete details&quot;, refer to
+  the OpenSSL &quot;README&quot; file. As for which list to send it to:
+
+  * openssl-users: if you are *using* the ENGINE abstraction, either in an
+    pre-compiled application or in your own application code.
+
+  * openssl-dev: if you are discussing problems with OpenSSL source code.
+
+  USAGE
+  =====
+
+  The default &quot;openssl&quot; ENGINE is always chosen when performing crypto
+  operations unless you specify otherwise. You must actively tell the
+  openssl utility commands to use anything else through a new command line
+  switch called &quot;-engine&quot;. Also, if you want to use the ENGINE support in
+  your own code to do something similar, you must likewise explicitly
+  select the ENGINE implementation you want.
+
+  Depending on the type of hardware, system, and configuration, &quot;settings&quot;
+  may need to be applied to an ENGINE for it to function as expected/hoped.
+  The recommended way of doing this is for the application to support
+  ENGINE &quot;control commands&quot; so that each ENGINE implementation can provide
+  whatever configuration primitives it might require and the application
+  can allow the user/admin (and thus the hardware vendor's support desk
+  also) to provide any such input directly to the ENGINE implementation.
+  This way, applications do not need to know anything specific to any
+  device, they only need to provide the means to carry such user/admin
+  input through to the ENGINE in question. Ie. this connects *you* (and
+  your helpdesk) to the specific ENGINE implementation (and device), and
+  allows application authors to not get buried in hassle supporting
+  arbitrary devices they know (and care) nothing about.
+
+  A new &quot;openssl&quot; utility, &quot;openssl engine&quot;, has been added in that allows
+  for testing and examination of ENGINE implementations. Basic usage
+  instructions are available by specifying the &quot;-?&quot; command line switch.
+
+  DYNAMIC ENGINES
+  ===============
+
+  The new &quot;dynamic&quot; ENGINE provides a low-overhead way to support ENGINE
+  implementations that aren't pre-compiled and linked into OpenSSL-based
+  applications. This could be because existing compiled-in implementations
+  have known problems and you wish to use a newer version with an existing
+  application. It could equally be because the application (or OpenSSL
+  library) you are using simply doesn't have support for the ENGINE you
+  wish to use, and the ENGINE provider (eg. hardware vendor) is providing
+  you with a self-contained implementation in the form of a shared-library.
+  The other use-case for &quot;dynamic&quot; is with applications that wish to
+  maintain the smallest foot-print possible and so do not link in various
+  ENGINE implementations from OpenSSL, but instead leaves you to provide
+  them, if you want them, in the form of &quot;dynamic&quot;-loadable
+  shared-libraries. It should be possible for hardware vendors to provide
+  their own shared-libraries to support arbitrary hardware to work with
+  applications based on OpenSSL 0.9.7 or later. If you're using an
+  application based on 0.9.7 (or later) and the support you desire is only
+  announced for versions later than the one you need, ask the vendor to
+  backport their ENGINE to the version you need.
+
+  How does &quot;dynamic&quot; work?
+  ------------------------
+
+  The dynamic ENGINE has a special flag in its implementation such that
+  every time application code asks for the 'dynamic' ENGINE, it in fact
+  gets its own copy of it. As such, multi-threaded code (or code that
+  multiplexes multiple uses of 'dynamic' in a single application in any
+  way at all) does not get confused by 'dynamic' being used to do many
+  independent things. Other ENGINEs typically don't do this so there is
+  only ever 1 ENGINE structure of its type (and reference counts are used
+  to keep order). The dynamic ENGINE itself provides absolutely no
+  cryptographic functionality, and any attempt to &quot;initialise&quot; the ENGINE
+  automatically fails. All it does provide are a few &quot;control commands&quot;
+  that can be used to control how it will load an external ENGINE
+  implementation from a shared-library. To see these control commands,
+  use the command-line;
+
+    openssl engine -vvvv dynamic
+
+  The &quot;SO_PATH&quot; control command should be used to identify the
+  shared-library that contains the ENGINE implementation, and &quot;NO_VCHECK&quot;
+  might possibly be useful if there is a minor version conflict and you
+  (or a vendor helpdesk) is convinced you can safely ignore it.
+  &quot;ID&quot; is probably only needed if a shared-library implements
+  multiple ENGINEs, but if you know the engine id you expect to be using,
+  it doesn't hurt to specify it (and this provides a sanity check if
+  nothing else). &quot;LIST_ADD&quot; is only required if you actually wish the
+  loaded ENGINE to be discoverable by application code later on using the
+  ENGINE's &quot;id&quot;. For most applications, this isn't necessary - but some
+  application authors may have nifty reasons for using it. The &quot;LOAD&quot;
+  command is the only one that takes no parameters and is the command
+  that uses the settings from any previous commands to actually *load*
+  the shared-library ENGINE implementation. If this command succeeds, the
+  (copy of the) 'dynamic' ENGINE will magically morph into the ENGINE
+  that has been loaded from the shared-library. As such, any control
+  commands supported by the loaded ENGINE could then be executed as per
+  normal. Eg. if ENGINE &quot;foo&quot; is implemented in the shared-library
+  &quot;libfoo.so&quot; and it supports some special control command &quot;CMD_FOO&quot;, the
+  following code would load and use it (NB: obviously this code has no
+  error checking);
+
+     ENGINE *e = ENGINE_by_id(&quot;dynamic&quot;);
+     ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, &quot;SO_PATH&quot;, &quot;/lib/libfoo.so&quot;, 0);
+     ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, &quot;ID&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, 0);
+     ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, &quot;LOAD&quot;, NULL, 0);
+     ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, &quot;CMD_FOO&quot;, &quot;some input data&quot;, 0);
+
+  For testing, the &quot;openssl engine&quot; utility can be useful for this sort
+  of thing. For example the above code excerpt would achieve much the
+  same result as;
+
+     openssl engine dynamic \
+               -pre SO_PATH:/lib/libfoo.so \
+               -pre ID:foo \
+               -pre LOAD \
+               -pre &quot;CMD_FOO:some input data&quot;
+
+  Or to simply see the list of commands supported by the &quot;foo&quot; ENGINE;
+
+     openssl engine -vvvv dynamic \
+               -pre SO_PATH:/lib/libfoo.so \
+               -pre ID:foo \
+               -pre LOAD
+
+  Applications that support the ENGINE API and more specifically, the
+  &quot;control commands&quot; mechanism, will provide some way for you to pass
+  such commands through to ENGINEs. As such, you would select &quot;dynamic&quot;
+  as the ENGINE to use, and the parameters/commands you pass would
+  control the *actual* ENGINE used. Each command is actually a name-value
+  pair and the value can sometimes be omitted (eg. the &quot;LOAD&quot; command).
+  Whilst the syntax demonstrated in &quot;openssl engine&quot; uses a colon to
+  separate the command name from the value, applications may provide
+  their own syntax for making that separation (eg. a win32 registry
+  key-value pair may be used by some applications). The reason for the
+  &quot;-pre&quot; syntax in the &quot;openssl engine&quot; utility is that some commands
+  might be issued to an ENGINE *after* it has been initialised for use.
+  Eg. if an ENGINE implementation requires a smart-card to be inserted
+  during initialisation (or a PIN to be typed, or whatever), there may be
+  a control command you can issue afterwards to &quot;forget&quot; the smart-card
+  so that additional initialisation is no longer possible. In
+  applications such as web-servers, where potentially volatile code may
+  run on the same host system, this may provide some arguable security
+  value. In such a case, the command would be passed to the ENGINE after
+  it has been initialised for use, and so the &quot;-post&quot; switch would be
+  used instead. Applications may provide a different syntax for
+  supporting this distinction, and some may simply not provide it at all
+  (&quot;-pre&quot; is almost always what you're after, in reality).
+
+  How do I build a &quot;dynamic&quot; ENGINE?
+  ----------------------------------
+
+  This question is trickier - currently OpenSSL bundles various ENGINE
+  implementations that are statically built in, and any application that
+  calls the &quot;ENGINE_load_builtin_engines()&quot; function will automatically
+  have all such ENGINEs available (and occupying memory). Applications
+  that don't call that function have no ENGINEs available like that and
+  would have to use &quot;dynamic&quot; to load any such ENGINE - but on the other
+  hand such applications would only have the memory footprint of any
+  ENGINEs explicitly loaded using user/admin provided control commands.
+  The main advantage of not statically linking ENGINEs and only using
+  &quot;dynamic&quot; for hardware support is that any installation using no
+  &quot;external&quot; ENGINE suffers no unnecessary memory footprint from unused
+  ENGINEs. Likewise, installations that do require an ENGINE incur the
+  overheads from only *that* ENGINE once it has been loaded.
+
+  Sounds good? Maybe, but currently building an ENGINE implementation as
+  a shared-library that can be loaded by &quot;dynamic&quot; isn't automated in
+  OpenSSL's build process. It can be done manually quite easily however.
+  Such a shared-library can either be built with any OpenSSL code it
+  needs statically linked in, or it can link dynamically against OpenSSL
+  if OpenSSL itself is built as a shared library. The instructions are
+  the same in each case, but in the former (statically linked any
+  dependencies on OpenSSL) you must ensure OpenSSL is built with
+  position-independent code (&quot;PIC&quot;). The default OpenSSL compilation may
+  already specify the relevant flags to do this, but you should consult
+  with your compiler documentation if you are in any doubt.
+
+  This example will show building the &quot;atalla&quot; ENGINE in the
+  crypto/engine/ directory as a shared-library for use via the &quot;dynamic&quot;
+  ENGINE.
+
+  1. &quot;cd&quot; to the crypto/engine/ directory of a pre-compiled OpenSSL
+  source tree.
+
+  2. Recompile at least one source file so you can see all the compiler
+  flags (and syntax) being used to build normally. Eg;
+
+    touch hw_atalla.c ; make
+
+  will rebuild &quot;hw_atalla.o&quot; using all such flags.
+
+  3. Manually enter the same compilation line to compile the
+  &quot;hw_atalla.c&quot; file but with the following two changes;
+  * add &quot;-DENGINE_DYNAMIC_SUPPORT&quot; to the command line switches,
+  * change the output file from &quot;hw_atalla.o&quot; to something new,
+  eg. &quot;tmp_atalla.o&quot;
+
+  4. Link &quot;tmp_atalla.o&quot; into a shared-library using the top-level
+  OpenSSL libraries to resolve any dependencies. The syntax for doing
+  this depends heavily on your system/compiler and is a nightmare
+  known well to anyone who has worked with shared-library portability
+  before. 'gcc' on Linux, for example, would use the following syntax;
+
+    gcc -shared -o dyn_atalla.so tmp_atalla.o -L../.. -lcrypto
+
+  5. Test your shared library using &quot;openssl engine&quot; as explained in the
+  previous section. Eg. from the top-level directory, you might try
+
+    apps/openssl engine -vvvv dynamic \
+          -pre SO_PATH:./crypto/engine/dyn_atalla.so -pre LOAD
+
+  If the shared-library loads successfully, you will see both &quot;-pre&quot;
+  commands marked as &quot;SUCCESS&quot; and the list of control commands
+  displayed (because of &quot;-vvvv&quot;) will be the control commands for the
+  *atalla* ENGINE (ie. *not* the 'dynamic' ENGINE). You can also add
+  the &quot;-t&quot; switch to the utility if you want it to try and initialise
+  the atalla ENGINE for use to test any possible hardware/driver issues.
+
+  PROBLEMS
+  ========
+
+  It seems like the ENGINE part doesn't work too well with CryptoSwift on Win32.
+  A quick test done right before the release showed that trying &quot;openssl speed
+  -engine cswift&quot; generated errors. If the DSO gets enabled, an attempt is made
+  to write at memory address 0x00000002.

-  ENGINE
-  ======
-
-  With OpenSSL 0.9.6, a new component was added to support alternative
-  cryptography implementations, most commonly for interfacing with external
-  crypto devices (eg. accelerator cards). This component is called ENGINE,
-  and its presence in OpenSSL 0.9.6 (and subsequent bug-fix releases)
-  caused a little confusion as 0.9.6** releases were rolled in two
-  versions, a &quot;standard&quot; and an &quot;engine&quot; version. In development for 0.9.7,
-  the ENGINE code has been merged into the main branch and will be present
-  in the standard releases from 0.9.7 forwards.
-
-  There are currently built-in ENGINE implementations for the following
-  crypto devices:
-
-      o Microsoft CryptoAPI
-      o VIA Padlock
-      o nCipher CHIL
-
-  In addition, dynamic binding to external ENGINE implementations is now
-  provided by a special ENGINE called &quot;dynamic&quot;. See the &quot;DYNAMIC ENGINE&quot;
-  section below for details.
-
-  At this stage, a number of things are still needed and are being worked on:
-
-      1 Integration of EVP support.
-      2 Configuration support.
-      3 Documentation!
-
-1 With respect to EVP, this relates to support for ciphers and digests in
-  the ENGINE model so that alternative implementations of existing
-  algorithms/modes (or previously unimplemented ones) can be provided by
-  ENGINE implementations.
-
-2 Configuration support currently exists in the ENGINE API itself, in the
-  form of &quot;control commands&quot;. These allow an application to expose to the
-  user/admin the set of commands and parameter types a given ENGINE
-  implementation supports, and for an application to directly feed string
-  based input to those ENGINEs, in the form of name-value pairs. This is an
-  extensible way for ENGINEs to define their own &quot;configuration&quot; mechanisms
-  that are specific to a given ENGINE (eg. for a particular hardware
-  device) but that should be consistent across *all* OpenSSL-based
-  applications when they use that ENGINE. Work is in progress (or at least
-  in planning) for supporting these control commands from the CONF (or
-  NCONF) code so that applications using OpenSSL's existing configuration
-  file format can have ENGINE settings specified in much the same way.
-  Presently however, applications must use the ENGINE API itself to provide
-  such functionality. To see first hand the types of commands available
-  with the various compiled-in ENGINEs (see further down for dynamic
-  ENGINEs), use the &quot;engine&quot; openssl utility with full verbosity, ie;
-       openssl engine -vvvv
-
-3 Documentation? Volunteers welcome! The source code is reasonably well
-  self-documenting, but some summaries and usage instructions are needed -
-  moreover, they are needed in the same POD format the existing OpenSSL
-  documentation is provided in. Any complete or incomplete contributions
-  would help make this happen.
-
-  STABILITY &amp; BUG-REPORTS
-  =======================
-
-  What already exists is fairly stable as far as it has been tested, but
-  the test base has been a bit small most of the time. For the most part,
-  the vendors of the devices these ENGINEs support have contributed to the
-  development and/or testing of the implementations, and *usually* (with no
-  guarantees) have experience in using the ENGINE support to drive their
-  devices from common OpenSSL-based applications. Bugs and/or inexplicable
-  behaviour in using a specific ENGINE implementation should be sent to the
-  author of that implementation (if it is mentioned in the corresponding C
-  file), and in the case of implementations for commercial hardware
-  devices, also through whatever vendor support channels are available.  If
-  none of this is possible, or the problem seems to be something about the
-  ENGINE API itself (ie. not necessarily specific to a particular ENGINE
-  implementation) then you should mail complete details to the relevant
-  OpenSSL mailing list. For a definition of &quot;complete details&quot;, refer to
-  the OpenSSL &quot;README&quot; file. As for which list to send it to;
-
-     openssl-users: if you are *using* the ENGINE abstraction, either in an
-          pre-compiled application or in your own application code.
-
-     openssl-dev: if you are discussing problems with OpenSSL source code.
-
-  USAGE
-  =====
-
-  The default &quot;openssl&quot; ENGINE is always chosen when performing crypto
-  operations unless you specify otherwise. You must actively tell the
-  openssl utility commands to use anything else through a new command line
-  switch called &quot;-engine&quot;. Also, if you want to use the ENGINE support in
-  your own code to do something similar, you must likewise explicitly
-  select the ENGINE implementation you want.
-
-  Depending on the type of hardware, system, and configuration, &quot;settings&quot;
-  may need to be applied to an ENGINE for it to function as expected/hoped.
-  The recommended way of doing this is for the application to support
-  ENGINE &quot;control commands&quot; so that each ENGINE implementation can provide
-  whatever configuration primitives it might require and the application
-  can allow the user/admin (and thus the hardware vendor's support desk
-  also) to provide any such input directly to the ENGINE implementation.
-  This way, applications do not need to know anything specific to any
-  device, they only need to provide the means to carry such user/admin
-  input through to the ENGINE in question. Ie. this connects *you* (and
-  your helpdesk) to the specific ENGINE implementation (and device), and
-  allows application authors to not get buried in hassle supporting
-  arbitrary devices they know (and care) nothing about.
-
-  A new &quot;openssl&quot; utility, &quot;openssl engine&quot;, has been added in that allows
-  for testing and examination of ENGINE implementations. Basic usage
-  instructions are available by specifying the &quot;-?&quot; command line switch.
-
-  DYNAMIC ENGINES
-  ===============
-
-  The new &quot;dynamic&quot; ENGINE provides a low-overhead way to support ENGINE
-  implementations that aren't pre-compiled and linked into OpenSSL-based
-  applications. This could be because existing compiled-in implementations
-  have known problems and you wish to use a newer version with an existing
-  application. It could equally be because the application (or OpenSSL
-  library) you are using simply doesn't have support for the ENGINE you
-  wish to use, and the ENGINE provider (eg. hardware vendor) is providing
-  you with a self-contained implementation in the form of a shared-library.
-  The other use-case for &quot;dynamic&quot; is with applications that wish to
-  maintain the smallest foot-print possible and so do not link in various
-  ENGINE implementations from OpenSSL, but instead leaves you to provide
-  them, if you want them, in the form of &quot;dynamic&quot;-loadable
-  shared-libraries. It should be possible for hardware vendors to provide
-  their own shared-libraries to support arbitrary hardware to work with
-  applications based on OpenSSL 0.9.7 or later. If you're using an
-  application based on 0.9.7 (or later) and the support you desire is only
-  announced for versions later than the one you need, ask the vendor to
-  backport their ENGINE to the version you need.
-
-  How does &quot;dynamic&quot; work?
-  ------------------------
-    The dynamic ENGINE has a special flag in its implementation such that
-    every time application code asks for the 'dynamic' ENGINE, it in fact
-    gets its own copy of it. As such, multi-threaded code (or code that
-    multiplexes multiple uses of 'dynamic' in a single application in any
-    way at all) does not get confused by 'dynamic' being used to do many
-    independent things. Other ENGINEs typically don't do this so there is
-    only ever 1 ENGINE structure of its type (and reference counts are used
-    to keep order). The dynamic ENGINE itself provides absolutely no
-    cryptographic functionality, and any attempt to &quot;initialise&quot; the ENGINE
-    automatically fails. All it does provide are a few &quot;control commands&quot;
-    that can be used to control how it will load an external ENGINE
-    implementation from a shared-library. To see these control commands,
-    use the command-line;
-
-       openssl engine -vvvv dynamic
-
-    The &quot;SO_PATH&quot; control command should be used to identify the
-    shared-library that contains the ENGINE implementation, and &quot;NO_VCHECK&quot;
-    might possibly be useful if there is a minor version conflict and you
-    (or a vendor helpdesk) is convinced you can safely ignore it.
-    &quot;ID&quot; is probably only needed if a shared-library implements
-    multiple ENGINEs, but if you know the engine id you expect to be using,
-    it doesn't hurt to specify it (and this provides a sanity check if
-    nothing else). &quot;LIST_ADD&quot; is only required if you actually wish the
-    loaded ENGINE to be discoverable by application code later on using the
-    ENGINE's &quot;id&quot;. For most applications, this isn't necessary - but some
-    application authors may have nifty reasons for using it. The &quot;LOAD&quot;
-    command is the only one that takes no parameters and is the command
-    that uses the settings from any previous commands to actually *load*
-    the shared-library ENGINE implementation. If this command succeeds, the
-    (copy of the) 'dynamic' ENGINE will magically morph into the ENGINE
-    that has been loaded from the shared-library. As such, any control
-    commands supported by the loaded ENGINE could then be executed as per
-    normal. Eg. if ENGINE &quot;foo&quot; is implemented in the shared-library
-    &quot;libfoo.so&quot; and it supports some special control command &quot;CMD_FOO&quot;, the
-    following code would load and use it (NB: obviously this code has no
-    error checking);
-
-       ENGINE *e = ENGINE_by_id(&quot;dynamic&quot;);
-       ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, &quot;SO_PATH&quot;, &quot;/lib/libfoo.so&quot;, 0);
-       ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, &quot;ID&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, 0);
-       ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, &quot;LOAD&quot;, NULL, 0);
-       ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, &quot;CMD_FOO&quot;, &quot;some input data&quot;, 0);
-
-    For testing, the &quot;openssl engine&quot; utility can be useful for this sort
-    of thing. For example the above code excerpt would achieve much the
-    same result as;
-
-       openssl engine dynamic \
-                 -pre SO_PATH:/lib/libfoo.so \
-                 -pre ID:foo \
-                 -pre LOAD \
-                 -pre &quot;CMD_FOO:some input data&quot;
-
-    Or to simply see the list of commands supported by the &quot;foo&quot; ENGINE;
-
-       openssl engine -vvvv dynamic \
-                 -pre SO_PATH:/lib/libfoo.so \
-                 -pre ID:foo \
-                 -pre LOAD
-
-    Applications that support the ENGINE API and more specifically, the
-    &quot;control commands&quot; mechanism, will provide some way for you to pass
-    such commands through to ENGINEs. As such, you would select &quot;dynamic&quot;
-    as the ENGINE to use, and the parameters/commands you pass would
-    control the *actual* ENGINE used. Each command is actually a name-value
-    pair and the value can sometimes be omitted (eg. the &quot;LOAD&quot; command).
-    Whilst the syntax demonstrated in &quot;openssl engine&quot; uses a colon to
-    separate the command name from the value, applications may provide
-    their own syntax for making that separation (eg. a win32 registry
-    key-value pair may be used by some applications). The reason for the
-    &quot;-pre&quot; syntax in the &quot;openssl engine&quot; utility is that some commands
-    might be issued to an ENGINE *after* it has been initialised for use.
-    Eg. if an ENGINE implementation requires a smart-card to be inserted
-    during initialisation (or a PIN to be typed, or whatever), there may be
-    a control command you can issue afterwards to &quot;forget&quot; the smart-card
-    so that additional initialisation is no longer possible. In
-    applications such as web-servers, where potentially volatile code may
-    run on the same host system, this may provide some arguable security
-    value. In such a case, the command would be passed to the ENGINE after
-    it has been initialised for use, and so the &quot;-post&quot; switch would be
-    used instead. Applications may provide a different syntax for
-    supporting this distinction, and some may simply not provide it at all
-    (&quot;-pre&quot; is almost always what you're after, in reality).
-
-  How do I build a &quot;dynamic&quot; ENGINE?
-  ----------------------------------
-    This question is trickier - currently OpenSSL bundles various ENGINE
-    implementations that are statically built in, and any application that
-    calls the &quot;ENGINE_load_builtin_engines()&quot; function will automatically
-    have all such ENGINEs available (and occupying memory). Applications
-    that don't call that function have no ENGINEs available like that and
-    would have to use &quot;dynamic&quot; to load any such ENGINE - but on the other

 OpenSSL, and it pretty much completely restructures the underlying mechanics of
 the &quot;ENGINE&quot; code. So it serves a double purpose of being a &quot;ENGINE internals
