    More tweaks to the installation instructions
    
    A few things were out of date and a few things were missing. Also some
    formatting updates.

-  threads       Build with support for multi-threaded applications.
-                This will usually require additional system-dependent options!

-  no-zlib       Don't try to build with support for zlib compression and
-                decompression.
-
-  zlib          Build with support for zlib compression/decompression.
-
-  zlib-dynamic  Like &quot;zlib&quot;, but has OpenSSL load the zlib library dynamically
-                when needed.  This is only supported on systems where loading
-                of shared libraries is supported.  This is the default choice.
-
-  no-shared     Don't try to create shared libraries.
-
-  shared        In addition to the usual static libraries, create shared
-                libraries on platforms where it's supported.  See &quot;Note on
-                shared libraries&quot; below.
-
-  no-asm        Do not use assembler code.
-
-  386           On Intel hardware, use the 80386 instruction set only
-                (the default x86 code is more efficient, but requires at
-                least a 486). Note: Use compiler flags for any other CPU
-                specific configuration, e.g. &quot;-m32&quot; to build x86 code on
-                an x64 system.
-
-  no-sse2	Exclude SSE2 code pathes. Normally SSE2 extension is
-		detected at run-time, but the decision whether or not the
-		machine code will be executed is taken solely on CPU
-		capability vector. This means that if you happen to run OS
-		kernel which does not support SSE2 extension on Intel P4
-		processor, then your application might be exposed to
-		&quot;illegal instruction&quot; exception. There might be a way
-		to enable support in kernel, e.g. FreeBSD kernel can be
-		compiled with CPU_ENABLE_SSE, and there is a way to
-		disengage SSE2 code pathes upon application start-up,
-		but if you aim for wider &quot;audience&quot; running such kernel,
-		consider no-sse2. Both 386 and no-asm options above imply
-		no-sse2.
-
-  no-&lt;cipher&gt;   Build without the specified cipher (bf, cast, des, dh, dsa,
-                hmac, md2, md5, mdc2, rc2, rc4, rc5, rsa, sha).
