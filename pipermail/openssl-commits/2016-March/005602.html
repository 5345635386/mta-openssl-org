  Cygwin implements a Posix/Unix runtime system (cygwin1.dll) on top of the

- Linking your application
- ------------------------
-
- If you link with static OpenSSL libraries then you're expected to
- additionally link your application with WS2_32.LIB, ADVAPI32.LIB,
- GDI32.LIB and USER32.LIB. Those developing non-interactive service
- applications might feel concerned about linking with the latter two,
- as they are justly associated with interactive desktop, which is not
- available to service processes. The toolkit is designed to detect in
- which context it's currently executed, GUI, console app or service,
- and act accordingly, namely whether or not to actually make GUI calls.
- Additionally those who wish to /DELAYLOAD:GDI32.DLL and /DELAYLOAD:USER32.DLL
- and actually keep them off service process should consider
- implementing and exporting from .exe image in question own
- _OPENSSL_isservice not relying on USER32.DLL.
- E.g., on Windows Vista and later you could:
-
-	__declspec(dllexport) __cdecl BOOL _OPENSSL_isservice(void)
-	{   DWORD sess;
-	    if (ProcessIdToSessionId(GetCurrentProcessId(),&amp;sess))
-	        return sess==0;
-	    return FALSE;
-	}
-
- If you link with OpenSSL .DLLs, then you're expected to include into
- your application code small &quot;shim&quot; snippet, which provides glue between
- OpenSSL BIO layer and your compiler run-time. See the OPENSSL_Applink
- manual page for further details.
