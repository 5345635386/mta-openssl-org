    Change the INSTALL documentation for unified builds
    
    Because of the unified scheme, building on different platforms is very
    similar.  We currently have Unix and OpenVMS on the unified scheme,
    which means that a separate INSTALL.VMS is no longer needed.

+ 1c. Configure OpenSSL for building outside of the source tree.
+
+     OpenSSL can be configured to build in a build directory separate from
+     the directory with the source code.  It's done by placing yourself in
+     some other directory and invoking the configuration commands from
+     there.
+
+     Unix example:
+
+       $ mkdir /var/tmp/openssl-build
+       $ cd /var/tmp/openssl-build
+       $ /PATH/TO/OPENSSL/SOURCE/config [options]
+
+       or
+
+       $ /PATH/TO/OPENSSL/SOURCE/Configure [target] [options]
+
+     OpenVMS example:
+
+       $ set default sys$login:
+       $ create/dir [.tmp.openssl-build]
+       $ set default [.tmp.openssl-build]
+       $ @[PATH.TO.OPENSSL.SOURCE]config {options}
+
+       or
+
+       $ @[PATH.TO.OPENSSL.SOURCE]Configure {target} {options}
+
+     Paths can be relative just as well as absolute.  Configure will
+     do its best to translate them to relative paths whenever possible.
+
   2. Build OpenSSL by running:
 
-       $ make
+       $ make                                           # Unix

-     This will build the OpenSSL libraries (libcrypto.a and libssl.a) and the

   *  COMPILING existing applications
 
-     To compile an application that uses old filenames -- e.g.
-     &quot;#include &lt;ssl.h&gt;&quot; --, it will usually be enough to find
-     the CFLAGS definition in the application's Makefile and
-     add a C option such as
-
-          -I/usr/local/ssl/include/openssl
-
-     to it.
-
-     But don't delete the existing -I option that points to
-     the ..../include directory!  Otherwise, OpenSSL header files
-     could not #include each other.
-
-  *  WRITING applications
-
-     To write an application that is able to handle both the new
-     and the old directory layout, so that it can still be compiled
-     with library versions up to OpenSSL 0.9.2b without bothering
-     the user, you can proceed as follows:
-
-     -  Always use the new filename of OpenSSL header files,
-        e.g. #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;.
+     OpenSSL 1.1 hides a number of structures that were previously
+     open.  This includes all internal libssl structures and a number
+     of EVP types.  Accessor functions have been added to allow
+     controlled access to the structures' data.
 
-     -  Create a directory &quot;incl&quot; that contains only a symbolic
-        link named &quot;openssl&quot;, which points to the &quot;include&quot; directory
-        of OpenSSL.
-        For example, your application's Makefile might contain the
-        following rule, if OPENSSLDIR is a pathname (absolute or
-        relative) of the directory where OpenSSL resides:
+     This means that some software needs to be rewritten to adapt to
+     the new ways of doing things.  This often amounts to allocating
+     an instance of a structure explicitly where you could previously
+     allocate them on the stack as automatic variables, and using the
+     provided accessor functions where you would previously access a
+     structure's field directly.
 
-        incl/openssl:
-        	-mkdir incl
-        	cd $(OPENSSLDIR) # Check whether the directory really exists
-        	-ln -s `cd $(OPENSSLDIR); pwd`/include incl/openssl
+     &lt;TBA&gt;
 
-        You will have to add &quot;incl/openssl&quot; to the dependencies
-        of those C files that include some OpenSSL header file.
-
-     -  Add &quot;-Iincl&quot; to your CFLAGS.
-
-     With these additions, the OpenSSL header files will be available
-     under both name variants if an old library version is used:
-     Your application can reach them under names like &lt;openssl/foo.h&gt;,
-     while the header files still are able to #include each other
-     with names of the form &lt;foo.h&gt;.

- Note on support for multiple builds
- -----------------------------------
-
- OpenSSL is usually built in its source tree.  Unfortunately, this doesn't
- support building for multiple platforms from the same source tree very well.
- It is however possible to build in a separate tree through the use of lots
- of symbolic links, which should be prepared like this:
-
-	mkdir -p objtree/&quot;`uname -s`-`uname -r`-`uname -m`&quot;
-	cd objtree/&quot;`uname -s`-`uname -r`-`uname -m`&quot;
-	(cd $OPENSSL_SOURCE; find . -type f) | while read F; do
-		mkdir -p `dirname $F`
-		rm -f $F; ln -s $OPENSSL_SOURCE/$F $F
-		echo $F '-&gt;' $OPENSSL_SOURCE/$F
-	done
-	make -f Makefile.in clean
-
- OPENSSL_SOURCE is an environment variable that contains the absolute (this
- is important!) path to the OpenSSL source tree.
-
- Also, operations like 'make update' should still be made in the source tree.

- INSTALLATION ON THE VMS PLATFORM
- --------------------------------
-
- Intro
- -----
-
- This file is divided in the following parts:
-
-   Requirements                 - Mandatory reading.
-   Cheking the distribution     - Mandatory reading.
-   Quick start
-   Test                         &lt;TO BE ADDED&gt;
-   Installation                 &lt;TO BE ADDED&gt;
-   Backward portability         &lt;TO BE ADDED&gt;
-   Possible bugs and quirks     &lt;TO BE ADDED&gt;
-
-
- Requirements
- ------------
-
- To build and install OpenSSL, you will need:
-
-  * Perl 5 with core modules (please read README.PERL)
-  * The perl module Text::Template (please read README.PERL)
-  * DEC C or some other ANSI C compiler.  VAX C is *not* supported.
-    [Note: OpenSSL has only been tested with DEC C.  Compiling with 
-     a different ANSI C compiler may require some work]
-
- Checking the distribution
- -------------------------
-
- There have been reports of places where the distribution didn't quite
- get through, for example if you've copied the tree from a NFS-mounted
- Unix mount point.
-
- The easiest way to check if everything got through as it should is to
- check for one of the following files:
-
-  [.crypto]opensslconf^.h.in
-
- The best way to get a correct distribution is to download the gzipped
- tar file from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/,">ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/,</A> use GUNZIP to uncompress
- it and use VMSTAR to unpack the resulting tar file.
-
- GUNZIP is available {FIXME: where is it available?}
-
- VMSTAR is available {FIXME: where is it available?}
-
-
- Quick start
- -----------
-
- If you want to just get on with it, do this:
-
-  $ @config
-  $ mms
-  $ mms test
-  $ mmm install
-
- This will buidl and install OpenSSL in the default location, which is
- SYS$COMMON:[OPENSSL-'VERSION'].  If you want it to be anywhere else,
- run config.com like this:
-
-  $ @config --prefix=PROGRAM:[OPENSSL]

+ ==============================
+
+ Requirement details
+ -------------------
+
+ In addition to the requirements listed in INSTALL, these are required
+ as well:
+
+  * At least ODS-5 disk organization for source and build.
+    Installation can be done on any existing disk organization.
+
+
+ About ANSI C compiler
+ ---------------------
+
+ An ANSI C compiled is needed among other things.  This means that VAX C
+ is not and will not be supported.
+
+ We have only tested with DEC C (a.k.a HP VMS C / VSI C), compiling with
+ a different ANSI C compiler may require some work.
