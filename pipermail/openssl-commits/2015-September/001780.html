      return an error
      [Rich Salz and Ismo Puustinen &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">ismo.puustinen at intel.com</A>&gt;]
 
-  *) Rewrite PSK to support ECDHE_PSK, DHE_PSK and RSA_PSK. Add ciphersuites
-     from RFC4279, RFC4785, RFC5487, RFC5489.
-
-     Thanks to Christian J. Dietrich and Giuseppe D'Angelo for the
-     original RSA_PSK patch.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Dropped support for the SSL3_FLAGS_DELAY_CLIENT_FINISHED flag. This SSLeay
-     era flag was never set throughout the codebase (only read). Also removed
-     SSL3_FLAGS_POP_BUFFER which was only used if
-     SSL3_FLAGS_DELAY_CLIENT_FINISHED was also set.
-     [Matt Caswell]
-
-  *) Changed the default name options in the &quot;ca&quot;, &quot;crl&quot;, &quot;req&quot; and &quot;x509&quot;
-     to be &quot;oneline&quot; instead of &quot;compat&quot;.
-     [Richard Levitte]
-
-  *) Remove SSL_OP_TLS_BLOCK_PADDING_BUG. This is SSLeay legacy, we're
-     not aware of clients that still exhibit this bug, and the workaround
-     hasn't been working properly for a while.
-     [Emilia K&#228;sper]
-
-  *) The return type of BIO_number_read() and BIO_number_written() as well as
-     the corresponding num_read and num_write members in the BIO structure has
-     changed from unsigned long to uint64_t. On platforms where an unsigned
-     long is 32 bits (e.g. Windows) these counters could overflow if &gt;4Gb is
-     transferred.
-     [Matt Caswell]
-
-  *) Given the pervasive nature of TLS extensions it is inadvisable to run
-     OpenSSL without support for them. It also means that maintaining
-     the OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT option within the code is very invasive (and probably
-     not well tested). Therefore the OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT option has been removed.
-     [Matt Caswell]
-
-  *) Removed support for the two export grade static DH ciphersuites
-     EXP-DH-RSA-DES-CBC-SHA and EXP-DH-DSS-DES-CBC-SHA. These two ciphersuites
-     were newly added (along with a number of other static DH ciphersuites) to
-     1.0.2. However the two export ones have *never* worked since they were
-     introduced. It seems strange in any case to be adding new export
-     ciphersuites, and given &quot;logjam&quot; it also does not seem correct to fix them.
-     [Matt Caswell]
-
-  *) Version negotiation has been rewritten. In particular SSLv23_method(),
-     SSLv23_client_method() and SSLv23_server_method() have been deprecated,
-     and turned into macros which simply call the new preferred function names
-     TLS_method(), TLS_client_method() and TLS_server_method(). All new code
-     should use the new names instead. Also as part of this change the ssl23.h
-     header file has been removed.
-     [Matt Caswell]
-
-  *) Support for Kerberos ciphersuites in TLS (RFC2712) has been removed. This
-     code and the associated standard is no longer considered fit-for-purpose.
-     [Matt Caswell]
-
-  *) RT2547 was closed.  When generating a private key, try to make the
-     output file readable only by the owner.  This behavior change might
-     be noticeable when interacting with other software.
-
-  *) Added HTTP GET support to the ocsp command.
-     [Rich Salz]
-
-  *) RAND_pseudo_bytes has been deprecated. Users should use RAND_bytes instead.
-     [Matt Caswell]
-
-  *) Added support for TLS extended master secret from
-     draft-ietf-tls-session-hash-03.txt. Thanks for Alfredo Pironti for an
-     initial patch which was a great help during development.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) All libssl internal structures have been removed from the public header
-     files, and the OPENSSL_NO_SSL_INTERN option has been removed (since it is
-     now redundant). Users should not attempt to access internal structures
-     directly. Instead they should use the provided API functions.
-     [Matt Caswell]
-
-  *) config has been changed so that by default OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED is used.
-     Access to deprecated functions can be re-enabled by running config with
-     &quot;enable-deprecated&quot;. In addition applications wishing to use deprecated
-     functions must define OPENSSL_USE_DEPRECATED. Note that this new behaviour
-     will, by default, disable some transitive includes that previously existed
-     in the header files (e.g. ec.h will no longer, by default, include bn.h)
-     [Matt Caswell]
-
-  *) Added support for OCB mode. OpenSSL has been granted a patent license
-     compatible with the OpenSSL license for use of OCB. Details are available
-     at <A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/docs/misc/OCB-patent-grant-OpenSSL.pdf.">https://www.openssl.org/docs/misc/OCB-patent-grant-OpenSSL.pdf.</A> Support
-     for OCB can be removed by calling config with no-ocb.
-     [Matt Caswell]
-
-  *) SSLv2 support has been removed.  It still supports receiving a SSLv2
-     compatible client hello.
-     [Kurt Roeckx]
-
-  *) Increased the minimal RSA keysize from 256 to 512 bits [Rich Salz],
-     done while fixing the error code for the key-too-small case.
-     [Annie Yousar &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">a.yousar at informatik.hu-berlin.de</A>&gt;]
-
-  *) CA.sh has been removmed; use CA.pl instead.
-     [Rich Salz]
-
-  *) Removed old DES API.
-     [Rich Salz]
-
-  *) Remove various unsupported platforms:
-        Sony NEWS4
-        BEOS and BEOS_R5
-        NeXT
-        SUNOS
-        MPE/iX
-        Sinix/ReliantUNIX RM400
-        DGUX
-        NCR
-        Tandem
-        Cray
-        16-bit platforms such as WIN16
-     [Rich Salz]
-
-  *) Clean up OPENSSL_NO_xxx #define's
-        Use setbuf() and remove OPENSSL_NO_SETVBUF_IONBF
-        Rename OPENSSL_SYSNAME_xxx to OPENSSL_SYS_xxx
-        OPENSSL_NO_EC{DH,DSA} merged into OPENSSL_NO_EC
-        OPENSSL_NO_RIPEMD160, OPENSSL_NO_RIPEMD merged into OPENSSL_NO_RMD160
-        OPENSSL_NO_FP_API merged into OPENSSL_NO_STDIO
-        Remove OPENSSL_NO_BIO OPENSSL_NO_BUFFER OPENSSL_NO_CHAIN_VERIFY
-        OPENSSL_NO_EVP OPENSSL_NO_FIPS_ERR OPENSSL_NO_HASH_COMP
-        OPENSSL_NO_LHASH OPENSSL_NO_OBJECT OPENSSL_NO_SPEED OPENSSL_NO_STACK
-        OPENSSL_NO_X509 OPENSSL_NO_X509_VERIFY
-        Remove MS_STATIC; it's a relic from platforms &lt;32 bits.
-     [Rich Salz]
-
-  *) Cleaned up dead code
-        Remove all but one '#ifdef undef' which is to be looked at.
-     [Rich Salz]
-
-  *) Clean up calling of xxx_free routines.
-        Just like free(), fix most of the xxx_free routines to accept
-        NULL.  Remove the non-null checks from callers.  Save much code.
-     [Rich Salz]
-
-  *) Add secure heap for storage of private keys (when possible).
-     Add BIO_s_secmem(), CBIGNUM, etc.
-     Contributed by Akamai Technologies under our Corporate CLA.
-     [Rich Salz]
-
-  *) Experimental support for a new, fast, unbiased prime candidate generator,
-     bn_probable_prime_dh_coprime(). Not currently used by any prime generator.
-     [Felix Laurie von Massenbach &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">felix at erbridge.co.uk</A>&gt;]
-
-  *) New output format NSS in the sess_id command line tool. This allows
-     exporting the session id and the master key in NSS keylog format.
-     [Martin Kaiser &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">martin at kaiser.cx</A>&gt;]
-
-  *) Harmonize version and its documentation. -f flag is used to display
-     compilation flags.
-     [mancha &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">mancha1 at zoho.com</A>&gt;]
-
-  *) Fix eckey_priv_encode so it immediately returns an error upon a failure
-     in i2d_ECPrivateKey.  Thanks to Ted Unangst for feedback on this issue.
-     [mancha &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">mancha1 at zoho.com</A>&gt;]
-
-  *) Fix some double frees. These are not thought to be exploitable.
-     [mancha &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">mancha1 at zoho.com</A>&gt;]
-
-  *) A missing bounds check in the handling of the TLS heartbeat extension
-     can be used to reveal up to 64k of memory to a connected client or
-     server.
-
-     Thanks for Neel Mehta of Google Security for discovering this bug and to
-     Adam Langley &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">agl at chromium.org</A>&gt; and Bodo Moeller &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">bmoeller at acm.org</A>&gt; for
-     preparing the fix (CVE-2014-0160)
-     [Adam Langley, Bodo Moeller]
-
-  *) Fix for the attack described in the paper &quot;Recovering OpenSSL
-     ECDSA Nonces Using the FLUSH+RELOAD Cache Side-channel Attack&quot;
-     by Yuval Yarom and Naomi Benger. Details can be obtained from:
-     <A HREF="http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/140">http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/140</A>
-
-     Thanks to Yuval Yarom and Naomi Benger for discovering this
-     flaw and to Yuval Yarom for supplying a fix (CVE-2014-0076)
-     [Yuval Yarom and Naomi Benger]
-
-  *) Use algorithm specific chains in SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file():
-     this fixes a limitation in previous versions of OpenSSL.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Experimental encrypt-then-mac support.
-    
-     Experimental support for encrypt then mac from
-     draft-gutmann-tls-encrypt-then-mac-02.txt
-
-     To enable it set the appropriate extension number (0x42 for the test
-     server) using e.g. -DTLSEXT_TYPE_encrypt_then_mac=0x42
- 
-     For non-compliant peers (i.e. just about everything) this should have no
-     effect.
-
-     WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
-
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Add EVP support for key wrapping algorithms, to avoid problems with
-     existing code the flag EVP_CIPHER_CTX_WRAP_ALLOW has to be set in
-     the EVP_CIPHER_CTX or an error is returned. Add AES and DES3 wrap
-     algorithms and include tests cases.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Extend CMS code to support RSA-PSS signatures and RSA-OAEP for
-     enveloped data.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Extended RSA OAEP support via EVP_PKEY API. Options to specify digest,
-     MGF1 digest and OAEP label.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Make openssl verify return errors.
-     [Chris Palmer &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">palmer at google.com</A>&gt; and Ben Laurie]
-
-  *) New function ASN1_TIME_diff to calculate the difference between two
-     ASN1_TIME structures or one structure and the current time.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Update fips_test_suite to support multiple command line options. New
-     test to induce all self test errors in sequence and check expected
-     failures.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Add FIPS_{rsa,dsa,ecdsa}_{sign,verify} functions which digest and
-     sign or verify all in one operation.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Add fips_algvs: a multicall fips utility incorporating all the algorithm
-     test programs and fips_test_suite. Includes functionality to parse
-     the minimal script output of fipsalgest.pl directly.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Add authorisation parameter to FIPS_module_mode_set().
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Add FIPS selftest for ECDH algorithm using P-224 and B-233 curves.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Use separate DRBG fields for internal and external flags. New function
-     FIPS_drbg_health_check() to perform on demand health checking. Add
-     generation tests to fips_test_suite with reduced health check interval to 
-     demonstrate periodic health checking. Add &quot;nodh&quot; option to
-     fips_test_suite to skip very slow DH test.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) New function FIPS_get_cipherbynid() to lookup FIPS supported ciphers
-     based on NID.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) More extensive health check for DRBG checking many more failure modes.
-     New function FIPS_selftest_drbg_all() to handle every possible DRBG
-     combination: call this in fips_test_suite.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Add support for Dual EC DRBG from SP800-90. Update DRBG algorithm test
-     and POST to handle Dual EC cases.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Add support for canonical generation of DSA parameter 'g'. See 
-     FIPS 186-3 A.2.3.
-
-  *) Add support for HMAC DRBG from SP800-90. Update DRBG algorithm test and
-     POST to handle HMAC cases.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Add functions FIPS_module_version() and FIPS_module_version_text()
-     to return numerical and string versions of the FIPS module number.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Rename FIPS_mode_set and FIPS_mode to FIPS_module_mode_set and
-     FIPS_module_mode. FIPS_mode and FIPS_mode_set will be implemented
-     outside the validated module in the FIPS capable OpenSSL.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Minor change to DRBG entropy callback semantics. In some cases
-     there is no multiple of the block length between min_len and
-     max_len. Allow the callback to return more than max_len bytes
-     of entropy but discard any extra: it is the callback's responsibility
-     to ensure that the extra data discarded does not impact the
-     requested amount of entropy.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Add PRNG security strength checks to RSA, DSA and ECDSA using 
-     information in FIPS186-3, SP800-57 and SP800-131A.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) CCM support via EVP. Interface is very similar to GCM case except we
-     must supply all data in one chunk (i.e. no update, final) and the
-     message length must be supplied if AAD is used. Add algorithm test
-     support.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Initial version of POST overhaul. Add POST callback to allow the status
-     of POST to be monitored and/or failures induced. Modify fips_test_suite
-     to use callback. Always run all selftests even if one fails.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) XTS support including algorithm test driver in the fips_gcmtest program.
-     Note: this does increase the maximum key length from 32 to 64 bytes but
-     there should be no binary compatibility issues as existing applications
-     will never use XTS mode.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Extensive reorganisation of FIPS PRNG behaviour. Remove all dependencies
-     to OpenSSL RAND code and replace with a tiny FIPS RAND API which also
-     performs algorithm blocking for unapproved PRNG types. Also do not
-     set PRNG type in FIPS_mode_set(): leave this to the application.
-     Add default OpenSSL DRBG handling: sets up FIPS PRNG and seeds with
-     the standard OpenSSL PRNG: set additional data to a date time vector.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Rename old X9.31 PRNG functions of the form FIPS_rand* to FIPS_x931*.
-     This shouldn't present any incompatibility problems because applications
-     shouldn't be using these directly and any that are will need to rethink
-     anyway as the X9.31 PRNG is now deprecated by FIPS 140-2
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Extensive self tests and health checking required by SP800-90 DRBG.
-     Remove strength parameter from FIPS_drbg_instantiate and always
-     instantiate at maximum supported strength.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Add ECDH code to fips module and fips_ecdhvs for primitives only testing.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) New algorithm test program fips_dhvs to handle DH primitives only testing.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) New function DH_compute_key_padded() to compute a DH key and pad with
-     leading zeroes if needed: this complies with SP800-56A et al.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Initial implementation of SP800-90 DRBGs for Hash and CTR. Not used by
-     anything, incomplete, subject to change and largely untested at present.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Modify fipscanisteronly build option to only build the necessary object
-     files by filtering FIPS_EX_OBJ through a perl script in crypto/Makefile.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Add experimental option FIPSSYMS to give all symbols in
-     fipscanister.o and FIPS or fips prefix. This will avoid
-     conflicts with future versions of OpenSSL. Add perl script
-     util/fipsas.pl to preprocess assembly language source files
-     and rename any affected symbols.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Add selftest checks and algorithm block of non-fips algorithms in
-     FIPS mode. Remove DES2 from selftests.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Add ECDSA code to fips module. Add tiny fips_ecdsa_check to just
-     return internal method without any ENGINE dependencies. Add new
-     tiny fips sign and verify functions.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) New build option no-ec2m to disable characteristic 2 code.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) New build option &quot;fipscanisteronly&quot;. This only builds fipscanister.o
-     and (currently) associated fips utilities. Uses the file Makefile.fips
-     instead of Makefile.org as the prototype.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Add some FIPS mode restrictions to GCM. Add internal IV generator.
-     Update fips_gcmtest to use IV generator.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Initial, experimental EVP support for AES-GCM. AAD can be input by
-     setting output buffer to NULL. The *Final function must be
-     called although it will not retrieve any additional data. The tag
-     can be set or retrieved with a ctrl. The IV length is by default 12
-     bytes (96 bits) but can be set to an alternative value. If the IV
-     length exceeds the maximum IV length (currently 16 bytes) it cannot be
-     set before the key. 
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) New flag in ciphers: EVP_CIPH_FLAG_CUSTOM_CIPHER. This means the
-     underlying do_cipher function handles all cipher semantics itself
-     including padding and finalisation. This is useful if (for example)
-     an ENGINE cipher handles block padding itself. The behaviour of
-     do_cipher is subtly changed if this flag is set: the return value
-     is the number of characters written to the output buffer (zero is
-     no longer an error code) or a negative error code. Also if the
-     input buffer is NULL and length 0 finalisation should be performed.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) If a candidate issuer certificate is already part of the constructed
-     path ignore it: new debug notification X509_V_ERR_PATH_LOOP for this case.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Improve forward-security support: add functions
-
-       void SSL_CTX_set_not_resumable_session_callback(SSL_CTX *ctx, int (*cb)(SSL *ssl, int is_forward_secure))
-       void SSL_set_not_resumable_session_callback(SSL *ssl, int (*cb)(SSL *ssl, int is_forward_secure))
-
-     for use by SSL/TLS servers; the callback function will be called whenever a
-     new session is created, and gets to decide whether the session may be
-     cached to make it resumable (return 0) or not (return 1).  (As by the
-     SSL/TLS protocol specifications, the session_id sent by the server will be
-     empty to indicate that the session is not resumable; also, the server will
-     not generate RFC 4507 (RFC 5077) session tickets.)
-
-     A simple reasonable callback implementation is to return is_forward_secure.
-     This parameter will be set to 1 or 0 depending on the ciphersuite selected
-     by the SSL/TLS server library, indicating whether it can provide forward
-     security.

-
-  *) New -verify_name option in command line utilities to set verification
-     parameters by name.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Initial CMAC implementation. WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL, API MAY CHANGE.
-     Add CMAC pkey methods.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Experimental renegotiation in s_server -www mode. If the client 
-     browses /reneg connection is renegotiated. If /renegcert it is
-     renegotiated requesting a certificate.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Add an &quot;external&quot; session cache for debugging purposes to s_server. This
-     should help trace issues which normally are only apparent in deployed
-     multi-process servers.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) Extensive audit of libcrypto with DEBUG_UNUSED. Fix many cases where
-     return value is ignored. NB. The functions RAND_add(), RAND_seed(),
-     BIO_set_cipher() and some obscure PEM functions were changed so they
-     can now return an error. The RAND changes required a change to the
-     RAND_METHOD structure.
-     [Steve Henson]
-
-  *) New macro __owur for &quot;OpenSSL Warn Unused Result&quot;. This makes use of
-     a gcc attribute to warn if the result of a function is ignored. This
-     is enable if DEBUG_UNUSED is set. Add to several functions in evp.h
-     whose return value is often ignored. 
-     [Steve Henson]

  Changes between 1.0.2c and 1.0.2d [9 Jul 2015]
 
   *) Alternate chains certificate forgery
