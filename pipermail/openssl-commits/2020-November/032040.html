-If you have any problems with OpenSSL then please take the following steps
-first:
-
- - Download the latest version from the repository
-   to see if the problem has already been addressed
- - Configure with no-asm
- - Remove compiler optimization flags
-
-If you wish to report a bug then please include the following information
-and create an issue on GitHub:
-
- - OpenSSL version: output of 'openssl version -a'
- - Configuration data: output of 'perl configdata.pm ==dump'
- - OS Name, Version, Hardware platform
- - Compiler Details (name, version)
- - Application Details (name, version)
- - Problem Description (steps that will reproduce the problem, if known)
- - Stack Traceback (if the application dumps core)
-
-Just because something doesn't work the way you expect does not mean it
-is necessarily a bug in OpenSSL. Use the openssl-users email list for this type
-of query.
-
-For *questions* on how to use OpenSSL or what went wrong when you
-tried something, our primary resource is the mailing list
<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">-openssl-users at openssl.org</A>, where you can get help from others in the
-OpenSSL community (which includes the developers as time permits).

 The list is not only watched by the OpenSSL team members, but also by many
 other OpenSSL users. Here you will most likely get the answer to your questions.
