+deprecation - How to do deprecation
 
 =head1 DESCRIPTION
 
 Deprecation of a symbol is adding an attribute to the declaration of that
 symbol (function, type, variable, but we currently only do that for
-functions in our F&lt;&lt; &lt;openssl/*.h&gt; &gt;&gt; header files).
+functions in our public header files, F&lt;&lt; &lt;openssl/*.h&gt; &gt;&gt;).
 
 Removal of a symbol is not the same thing as deprecation, as it actually
-removes the symbol from public view.
+explicitly removes the symbol from public view.
 
 OpenSSL configuration supports deprecation as well as simulating removal of
-symbols from public view, and also supports doing this in terms of a
-specified OpenSSL version.
+symbols from public view (with the configuration option `no-deprecated`, or
+if the user chooses to do so, with L&lt;OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED(7)&gt;), and also
+supports doing this in terms of a specified OpenSSL version (with the
+configuration option `--api`, or if the user chooses to do so, with
+L&lt;OPENSSL_API_COMPAT(7)&gt;).
 
-Deprecation is done using attribute macros having names starting with
-B&lt;OSSL_DEPRECATED&gt;, used with any declaration it applies to.
+Deprecation is done using attribute macros named
+B&lt;OSSL_DEPRECATEDIN_I&lt;version&gt;&gt;, used with any declaration it applies to.
 
-Simulating removal is done with guard macros having names starting with
-L&lt;OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED(7)&gt;.
+Simulating removal is done with C&lt;#ifndef&gt; preprocessor guards using macros
+named B&lt;OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED_I&lt;version&gt;&gt;.
 
-The implementation of a deprecated symbol is kept for two reasons:
+B&lt;OSSL_DEPRECATEDIN_I&lt;version&gt;&gt; and B&lt;OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED_I&lt;version&gt;&gt; are
+defined in F&lt;&lt; &lt;openssl/macros.h&gt; &gt;&gt;.
 
-=over 4
-
-=item Kept as legacy for the deprecation period
-
-It's implemented only to have it available as long as the symbol isn't
-removed entirely (be it by explicitly removing it when it's judged that it
-has been deprecated long enough, or because the removal is simulated).
-These need to be guarded appropriately, as shown in the L&lt;/Implementations
-kept as legacy&gt;.
-
-=item Kept for internal purposes
-
-The implementation doesn't need to change or be guarded.  However, it's
-necessary to ensure that the declaration remains available for the
-translation unit where the implementation is located, even when the symbol
-is publicly unavailable through simulated removal.  That's done by including
-an internal header file very early in the translation unit.  See
-L&lt;/Implementations kept for internal purposes&gt;.
+In those macro names, B&lt;I&lt;version&gt;&gt; corresponds to the OpenSSL release since
+which the deprecation applies, with underscores instead of periods.  Because
+of the change in version scheme with OpenSSL 3.0, the B&lt;I&lt;version&gt;&gt; for
+versions before that are three numbers (such as C&lt;1_1_0&gt;), while they are
+two numbers (such as C&lt;3_0&gt;) from 3.0 and on.
 
-In a future cleanup, the declaration should be explicitly moved to an
-internal header file, with the deprecation attribute removed, and the
-translation unit should adjust its header inclusions accordingly.
+The implementation of a deprecated symbol is kept for one of two reasons:

-specific macros instead&gt;
-
-OSSL_DEPRECATED() implements the deprecated attribute if the compiler
-supports it, otherwise it expands to nothing.  It takes one argument
-I&lt;since&gt; that should be set to the OpenSSL version where the symbol was
-deprecated, and will be displayed with the deprecation warning message,

-compilers that support user specified deprecation messages.
+=item Planned to be removed
 
-B&lt;OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED&gt; is a macro that's generated by OpenSSL
-configuration in response to the C&lt;no-deprecated&gt; configuration option.
-This macro suppresses the definition of deprecated symbols.
+The symbol and its implementation are planned to be removed some time in the
+future, but needs to remain available until that time.
+Such an implementation needs to be guarded appropriately, as shown in
+L&lt;/Implementations to be removed&gt; below.
 
-=head2 Version specific macros
+=item Planned to remain internally
 
-OSSL_DEPRECATEDIN_I&lt;major&gt;_I&lt;minor&gt;() macros that are defined to
-OSSL_DEPRECATED() with that version number as I&lt;since&gt;, for any version up
-to and including the one expressed with L&lt;OPENSSL_API_COMPAT(7)&gt;.  For any
-known version above the version expressed with L&lt;OPENSSL_API_COMPAT(7)&gt;,
-The are defined to nothing.
+The symbol is planned to be removed from public view, but will otherwise
+remain for internal purposes.  In this case, the implementation doesn't need
+to change or be guarded.
 
-OSSL_DEPRECATEDIN_I&lt;major&gt;_I&lt;minor&gt;_FOR() macros that are defined to
-OSSL_DEPRECATED() with that version number as I&lt;since&gt;, under the same
-conditions as OSSL_DEPRECATEDIN_I&lt;major&gt;_I&lt;minor&gt;().
+However, it's necessary to ensure that the declaration remains available for
+the translation unit where the symbol is used or implemented, even when the
+symbol is publicly unavailable through simulated removal.  That's done by
+including an internal header file very early in the affected translation
+units.  See L&lt;/Implementations to remain internally&gt; below.
 
-B&lt;OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED_I&lt;major&gt;_I&lt;minor&gt;&gt; macros should be used as
-guards around declarations that will eventually disappear from the public
-header files (F&lt;&lt; &lt;openssl/*.h&gt; &gt;&gt;).
+In the future, when the deprecated declaration is to actually be removed
+from public view, it should be moved to an internal header file, with the
+deprecation attribute removed, and the translation units that implement or
+use that symbol should adjust their header inclusions accordingly.
 
-Any set of symbols deprecated with a B&lt;OSSL_DEPRECATEDIN_I&lt;major&gt;_I&lt;minor&gt;&gt;
-attribute macro B&lt;must&gt; be wrapped with a guard using the corresponding
-B&lt;OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED_I&lt;major&gt;_I&lt;minor&gt;&gt; macro, see L&lt;/Header files&gt;
-example below.  This not only affects what the user of the header file will
-have available, it's also used to determine the conditions for exporting the
-symbol in the shared libraries.

 =head1 EXAMPLES
 
 =head2 Header files
 
-In public header files (F&lt;&lt; &lt;openssl/*.h&gt; &gt;&gt;), a deprecated symbol will
-always be wrapped with a negative test of the guard:
+In public header files (F&lt;&lt; &lt;openssl/*.h&gt; &gt;&gt;), this is what a deprecation is
+expected to look like, including the preprocessor wrapping for simulated
+removal:
 
- # ifndef OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED_1_1_0
- /* ... */
- OSSL_DEPRECATEDIN_1_1_0 __owur int
- HMAC_Init(HMAC_CTX *ctx, const void *key, int len, const EVP_MD *md);
+ # ifndef OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED_3_0
  /* ... */
- # endif
-
-=head2 Implementations of deprecated symbols
-
-At least for the period of deprecation for any symbol, its implementation
-needs to be kept, and for symbols that are kept internally, for longer than
-that.  There are two things to deal with:
-
-=over 4
-
-=item Deprecation warnings
-
-To remedy deprecation warnings, simply define the macro
-B&lt;OPENSSL_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATED&gt; at the beginning of the translation unit.
-
-=item Simulated removal
 
-=over 4
-
-=item *
-
-For symbols that are kept as legacy, the simulated removal should be
-enforced, by guarding the implementation the exact same way as the
-declaration in the public header file.
-
-=item *
-
-For symbols that are planned to be kept internally beyond their deprecation
-period, the translation units that implement them must ensure that the
-public header files they include to that declare the symbols don't remove
-the symbols, even when removal is otherwise simulated.
