  NOTES FOR THE WINDOWS PLATFORMS
  ===============================
 
- Requirement details for native (Visual C++) builds
- --------------------------------------------------
+ Windows targets can be classified as &quot;native&quot;, ones that use Windows API
+ directly, and &quot;hosted&quot; which rely on POSIX-compatible layer. &quot;Native&quot;
+ targets are VC-* (where &quot;VC&quot; stems from abbreviating Microsoft Visual C
+ compiler) and mingw[64]. &quot;Hosted&quot; platforms are Cygwin and MSYS[2]. Even
+ though the latter is not directly supported by OpenSSL Team, it's #1
+ popular choice for building MinGW targets. In the nutshell MinGW builds
+ are always cross-compiled. On Linux and Cygwin they look exactly as such
+ and require --cross-compile-prefix option. While on MSYS[2] it's solved
+ rather by placing gcc that produces &quot;MinGW binary&quot; code 1st on $PATH.
+ This is customarily source of confusion. &quot;Hosted&quot; applications &quot;live&quot; in
+ emulated file system name space with POSIX-y root, mount points, /dev
+ and even /proc. Confusion is intensified by the fact that MSYS2 shell
+ (or rather emulated execve(2) call) examines the binary it's about to
+ start, and if it's found *not* to be linked with MSYS2 POSIX-y thing,
+ command line arguments that look like file names get translated from
+ emulated name space to &quot;native&quot;. For example '/c/some/where' becomes
+ 'c:\some\where', '/dev/null' - 'nul'. This creates an illusion that
+ there is no difference between MSYS2 shell and &quot;MinGW binary&quot;, but
+ there is. Just keep in mind that &quot;MinGW binary&quot; &quot;experiences&quot; Windows
+ system in exactly same way as one produced by VC, and in its essence
+ is indistinguishable from the latter. (Which by the way is why
+ it's referred to in quotes here, as &quot;MinGW binary&quot;, it's just as
+ &quot;native&quot; as it can get.)

- GNU C (Cygwin)
- --------------
-
- Cygwin implements a Posix/Unix runtime system (cygwin1.dll) on top of the
- Windows subsystem and provides a bash shell and GNU tools environment.
- Consequently, a make of OpenSSL with Cygwin is virtually identical to the
- Unix procedure.
-
- To build OpenSSL using Cygwin, you need to:
-
- * Install Cygwin (see <A HREF="https://cygwin.com/">https://cygwin.com/</A>)
-
- * Install Cygwin Perl and ensure it is in the path. Recall that
-   as least 5.10.0 is required.
-
- * Run the Cygwin bash shell
-
- Apart from that, follow the Unix instructions in INSTALL.
-
- NOTE: &quot;make test&quot; and normal file operations may fail in directories
- mounted as text (i.e. mount -t c:\somewhere /home) due to Cygwin
- stripping of carriage returns. To avoid this ensure that a binary
- mount is used, e.g. mount -b c:\somewhere /home.
-
- It is also possible to create &quot;conventional&quot; Windows binaries that use
- the Microsoft C runtime system (msvcrt.dll or crtdll.dll) using MinGW
- development add-on for Cygwin. MinGW is supported even as a standalone
- setup as described in the following section. In the context you should
- recognize that binaries targeting Cygwin itself are not interchangeable
- with &quot;conventional&quot; Windows binaries you generate with/for MinGW.
+ mingw and mingw64
+ =================
 
+ * MSYS2 shell and development environment installation:
 
- GNU C (MinGW/MSYS)
- ------------------
+   Download MSYS2 from <A HREF="https://msys2.github.io/">https://msys2.github.io/</A> and follow installation
+   instructions. Once up and running install even make, perl, (git if
+   needed,) mingw-w64-i686-gcc and/or mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc. You should
+   have corresponding MinGW items on your start menu, use *them*, not
+   generic MSYS2. As implied in opening note, difference between them
+   is which compiler is found 1st on $PATH. At this point ./config
+   should recognize correct target, roll as if it was Unix...
 
- * Compiler and shell environment installation:
+ * It is also possible to build mingw[64] on Linux or Cygwin by
+   configuring with corresponding --cross-compile-prefix= option. For
+   example
 
-   MinGW and MSYS are available from <A HREF="http://www.mingw.org/,">http://www.mingw.org/,</A> both are
-   required. Run the installers and do whatever magic they say it takes
-   to start MSYS bash shell with GNU tools and matching Perl on its PATH.
-   &quot;Matching Perl&quot; refers to chosen &quot;shell environment&quot;, i.e. if built
-   under MSYS, then Perl compiled for MSYS must be used.
+     ./Configure mingw --cross-compile-prefix=i686-w64-mingw32- ...
 
-   Alternatively, one can use MSYS2 from <A HREF="https://msys2.github.io/,">https://msys2.github.io/,</A>

-   and i686-w64-mingw32-.
+     ./Configure mingw64 --cross-compile-prefix=x86_64-w64-mingw32- ...
