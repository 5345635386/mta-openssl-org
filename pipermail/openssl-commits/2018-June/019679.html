+ Linking your application
+ ------------------------
+
+ Third-party applications dynamically linked with OpenSSL (or any other)
+ shared library face exactly the same problem with non-default locations.
+ The OpenSSL config options mentioned above might or might not have bearing
+ on linking of the target application. &quot;Might&quot; means that under some
+ circumstances it would be sufficient to link with OpenSSL shared library
+ &quot;naturally&quot;, i.e. with -L/whatever/path -lssl -lcrypto. But there are
+ also cases when you'd have to explicitly specify runtime search path
+ when linking your application. Consult your system documentation and use
+ above section as inspiration...
+
+ Shared OpenSSL builds also install static libraries. Linking with the
+ latter is likely to require special care, because linkers usually look
+ for shared libraries first and tend to remain &quot;blind&quot; to static OpenSSL
+ libraries. Referring to system documentation would suffice, if not for
+ a corner case. On AIX static libraries (in shared build) are named
+ differently, add _a suffix to link with them, e.g. -lcrypto_a.
