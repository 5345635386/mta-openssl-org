+
+This is a recommended way to describe OSSL_STORE loaders,
+&quot;ossl_store-{name}&quot;, where {name} is replaced with the name of the
+scheme it implements, in man section 7.

+=head1 NAME
+
+ossl_store-file - The store 'file' scheme loader
+
+=head1 SYNOPSIS
+
+=for comment generic
+
+#include &lt;openssl/store.h&gt;
+
+=head1 DESCRIPTION
+
+Support for the 'file' scheme is built into C&lt;libcrypto&gt;.
+Since files come in all kinds of formats and content types, the 'file'
+scheme has its own layer of functionality called &quot;file handlers&quot;,
+which are used to try to decode diverse types of file contents.
+
+In case a file is formatted as PEM, each called file handler receives
+the PEM name (everything following any 'C&lt;-----BEGIN &gt;') as well as
+possible PEM headers, together with the decoded PEM body.  Since PEM
+formatted files can contain more than one object, the file handlers
+are called upon for each such object.
+
+If the file isn't determined to be formatted as PEM, the content is
+loaded in raw form in its entirety and passed to the available file
+handlers as is, with no PEM name or headers.
+
+Each file handler is expected to handle PEM and non-PEM content as
+appropriate.  Some may refuse non-PEM content for the sake of
+determinism (for example, there are keys out in the wild that are
+represented as an ASN.1 OCTET STRING.  In raw form, it's not easily
+possible to distinguish those from any other data coming as an ASN.1
+OCTET STRING, so such keys would naturally be accepted as PEM files
+only).
+
+=head1 NOTES
+
+When needed, the 'file' scheme loader will require a pass phrase by
+using the C&lt;UI_METHOD&gt; that was passed via OSSL_STORE_open().
+This pass phrase is used as it is, which may present some challenge
+when the file that's loaded contains a PKCS#12 object.
+See L&lt;passphrase-encoding(7)&gt; for more information.
+
+=begin comment
+
+The treatment of pass phrases is currently being worked on and may
+change.
