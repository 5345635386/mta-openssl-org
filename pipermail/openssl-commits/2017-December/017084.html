+OpenSSL Security Advisory [07 Dec 2017]
+========================================
+
+Read/write after SSL object in error state (CVE-2017-3737)
+==========================================================
+
+Severity: Moderate
+
+OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an &quot;error state&quot;
+mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then
+OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you
+attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit
+handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()),
+however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is
+called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error
+will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is
+subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will
+succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from
+the SSL/TLS record layer.
+
+In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that
+resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being issued after having already
+received a fatal error.
+
+This issue does not affect OpenSSL 1.1.0.
+
+OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2n
+
+This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 10th November 2017 by David Benjamin
+(Google). The fix was proposed by David Benjamin and implemented by Matt Caswell
+of the OpenSSL development team.
+
+rsaz_1024_mul_avx2 overflow bug on x86_64 (CVE-2017-3738)
+=========================================================
+
+Severity: Low
+
+There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure
+used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected.
+Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect
+would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks
+against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work
+necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline.
+The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant.
+However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share
+the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option
+since CVE-2016-0701.
+
+This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions
+like Intel Haswell (4th generation).
+
+Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732
+and CVE-2015-3193.
+
+Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of
+OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it
+becomes available. The fix is also available in commit e502cc86d in the OpenSSL
+git repository.
+
+OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2n
+
+This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 22nd November 2017 by David Benjamin
+(Google). The issue was originally found via the OSS-Fuzz project. The fix was
+developed by Andy Polyakov of the OpenSSL development team.
+
+Note
+====
+
+Support for version 1.0.1 ended on 31st December 2016. Support for versions
+0.9.8 and 1.0.0 ended on 31st December 2015. Those versions are no longer
+receiving security updates.
