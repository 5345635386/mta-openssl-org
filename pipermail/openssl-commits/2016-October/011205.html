+	  This document is intended to outline the OpenSSL project
+	  roadmap. It is a living document and is expected to change
+	  over time. Objectives and dates should be considered
+	  aspirational.&lt;/p&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;
+	  The OpenSSL project is increasingly perceived as slow-moving
+	  and insular. This roadmap will attempt to address this by
+	  setting out some objectives for improvement, along with
+	  defined timescales.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+	  &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name='toc'&gt;Table of Contents:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

+	    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#update&quot;&gt;Roadmap Update History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
+	  &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
+
+
+	  &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;current&quot;&gt;Current Issues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/up.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;
+	  The OpenSSL project is currently experiencing a number of issues.
+	  These are:&lt;/p&gt;
+	  &lt;ol&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;RT Backlog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
+	    Over a period of some considerable time open tickets have
+	    been building up in RT (our bug tracking system) to the
+	    point that now there are a very significant number of
+	    them. A large proportion of these issues have been open
+	    for years. Some of these have in fact been dealt with and
+	    should be closed, but this has not been recorded in the
+	    system. Most however have not been looked at.
+	    &lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incomplete/incorrect documentation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
+	    Documentation of OpenSSL is patchy at best. Some areas are
+	    well documented, while many others suffer from incomplete
+	    or incorrect documentation. There are also many areas
+	    which have no documentation at all.
+	    &lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Library complexity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
+	    The OpenSSL libraries and applications are complex,
+	    both from a maintainer's perspective and from a user's
+	    perspective. The public API contains many things which
+	    should probably be internal. The code has been ported
+	    to a large number of platforms, many of which are no
+	    longer relevant to us today, and this complicates the
+	    codebase. Some parts of the code have been in place for
+	    a very long time, and are in need of a refresh. It is
+	    further complicated by the support for FIPS.
+	    This complexity causes maintenance problems, and
+	    can also be the source of obscure and difficult to spot
+	    security vulnerabilities. It can also make users' lives
+	    much more difficult especially when combined with (2)
+	    above.
+	    The current memory management code has
+	    also been a source of problems and vulnerabilities.
+	    &lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inconsistent coding style&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
+	    There have been numerous developers working on the codebase
+	    over many years. There are many different styles used within
+	    the code, which is confusing and makes maintenance more
+	    difficult than it should be. Even if strictly consistent,
+	    the current code layout is unusual and idiosyncratic and
+	    unlike any other open source software.
+	    &lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lack of code review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
+	    We don't have a code review system and we don't mandate code
+	    reviews.
+	    &lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No clear release plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
+	    Historically OpenSSL has made new feature releases on
+	    an infrequent basis and no forward plan of releases has
+	    been published. It is difficult for users to plan for new
+	    releases, and understand when new features might become
+	    available, or when support will end for a release. In
+	    addition a large number of stable releases are maintained
+	    by the OpenSSL development team - diverting effort away
+	    from the most up to date versions.
+	    &lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No clear platform strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
+	    Historically OpenSSL has supported a very wide range of
+	    platforms. Typically platform support has been added through
+	    &quot;ifdef&quot; conditional compilation on a per platform
+	    basis. This approach has led to a number of problems:
+	    &lt;ul&gt;
+	      &lt;li&gt;
+	      The code has become very cluttered and is difficult to
+	      effectively maintain&lt;/li&gt;
+	      &lt;li&gt;
+	      There is support still in the code for a number of legacy
+	      platforms which are unlikely to be widely deployed today -
+	      if the code even still works on those platforms&lt;/li&gt;
+	      &lt;li&gt;
+	      In practice the development team do not have access to many of
+	      the platforms that the codebase supports and testing typically
+	      takes place on a very limited set (usually Linux, FreeBSD and
+	      Windows)&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;/ul&gt;
+	    &lt;del&gt;
+	      &lt;li&gt;
+	      &lt;em&gt;No published security strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
+	      We do not have a well-known and published approach for how we
+	      appropriately inform all interested parties of security
+	      advisories.&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;/del&gt;
+	  &lt;/ol&gt;
+
+	  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+
+	  &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;objectives&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/up.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;
+	  Each of the issues identified above can be translated into
+	  high level objectives. Some of these objectives can be
+	  achieved more easily and quickly than others.&lt;/p&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;
+	  &lt;em&gt;An important principle is that the priority and focus of
+	    effort will be on achieving these objectives over and above
+	    the delivery of new features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+
+	  &lt;h4&gt;RT Backlog&lt;/h4&gt;
+	  &lt;ol&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    Manage all newly submitted RT tickets in a timely
+	    manner such as an initial response within four working
+	    days. (Timescale: Now)&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    Reduce over time the existing RT backlog (Timescale:
+	    Ongoing). This may include the mass closure of very old
+	    tickets, such as those raised before the release of any
+	    currently supported version.
+	    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update (8th September 2014)&lt;/em&gt;:
+	    we have made a great deal of progress on the backlog.
+	    A &lt;a href=&quot;ticket-activity.png&quot;&gt;graph of ticket activity&lt;/a&gt;
+	    is available, as is the &lt;a href=&quot;buglist.txt&quot;&gt;raw data&lt;/a&gt;
+	    for every bug showing when it was open, and resolved. We
+	    will update these files periodically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
+	  &lt;/ol&gt;
+
+	  &lt;h4&gt;Incomplete/incorrect documentation&lt;/h4&gt;
+	   &lt;ol&gt;
+	     &lt;li&gt;
+	     Provide complete documentation for all of the public
+	     API (excluding deprecated APIs) (Timescale: Within one year).
+	     &lt;/li&gt;
+	     &lt;li&gt;Some parts of the API have historically been public but were
+	     not intended for public use, such as low level cipher and digest
+	     APIs. These parts may not be documented, and if they are will be
+	     marked as deprecated (Timescale: within nine months).&lt;/li&gt;
+	     &lt;li&gt;This may include introducing a new documentation system.&lt;/li&gt;
+	   &lt;/ol&gt;
+
+	  &lt;h4&gt;Library complexity&lt;/h4&gt;
+	  &lt;ol&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    Review and revise the public API with a view to reducing complexity
+	    (Timescale: Within one year)&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    Document a platform strategy: see below (Timescale: Within three
+	    months)&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    &lt;del&gt;Review and refactor the FIPS code to make it far less
+	    intrusive (Timescale: Within one year)&lt;/del&gt;
+	    &lt;br&gt;Objective met (2015): The FIPS code has been removed from the
+	    master branch, and will be re-integrated more cleanly during
+	    a future validation.
+	    &lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    &lt;del&gt;Review and refactor the memory management code.
+	    (Timescale: Within six months)&lt;/del&gt;
+	    &lt;br&gt;Objective met (2015): All use of dynamic memory allocation has
+	    been cleaned up and made consistent, and the internal memory
+	    pool has been removed.
+	    &lt;/li&gt;
+	  &lt;/ol&gt;
+
+	  &lt;h4&gt;Inconsistent coding style&lt;/h4&gt;
+	  &lt;ol&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    Define a clear coding standard for the project. This will cover not
+	    only code layout but also items such as how to handle platform
+	    dependencies, unit testing and optional code. (Timescale: Within
+	    three months).&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    &lt;del&gt;Format the entire codebase according to the agreed standard.
+	    (Timescale: Within three months of coding standard being
+	    defined).&lt;/del&gt;
+	    &lt;br&gt;Objective met (2015): All release branches were
+	    reformatted using a script included in the release.
+	    &lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    Refactor code to follow other parts of the style guide. (Timescale:
+	    Within one year)&lt;/li&gt;
+	  &lt;/ol&gt;
+
+	  &lt;h4&gt;Code review&lt;/h4&gt;
+	  &lt;ol&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    &lt;del&gt;
+	      Agree and implement a process such that all new commits
+	      should first be reviewed by a team member conversant
+	      with the relevant code and updated until the reviewer's
+	      issues are addressed. This is contingent on recruiting
+	      sufficient team members that reviewers are more-or-less
+	      always available. (Timescale: Within three months)
+	    &lt;/del&gt;
+	    &lt;br&gt;Objective met (16th July 2014): All changes are first reviewed by 
+	    another team member prior to being committed to the public openssl 
+	    repository.
+	    &lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    &lt;del&gt;
+	      Agree on a code review system. (Timescale: Within six months)
+	    &lt;/del&gt;
+	    &lt;br&gt;Objective met (2015): We use
+	    &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="https://gitlab.com">https://gitlab.com</A>&quot;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;.
+	    &lt;/li&gt;
+	  &lt;/ol&gt;
+
+	  &lt;h4&gt;Audit&lt;/h4&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;
+	  Externally audit the current code base. (Timescale: Dependent on
+	  external body)&lt;/p&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;Update (14th October 2014):
+	  Auditors selected and funded; schedule being worked on.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+	  &lt;h4&gt;Static/Dynamic Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;
+	  Regularly audit the code using appropriate analysis tools.
+	  (Timescale: Within six months)
+	  &lt;/p&gt;
+
+	  &lt;h4&gt;Release Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;
+	  &lt;del&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;
+	  We intend to develop a release strategy which will set out our plans
+	  for how frequently we plan to release, and when. It will also cover
+	  how long releases will be supported for, and when their EOL (End Of
+	  Life) will be. (Timescale: Within three months)&lt;/p&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;
+	  There are a number of objectives that we would be seeking to address
+	  within the release strategy. Some of these objectives compete with
+	  each other, and so from necessity there will have to be compromises.
+	  The objectives are:
+	  &lt;ol&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    We need security fix releases with very low chance of breaking
+	    anything. This is largely met by prohibiting new features in stable
+	    branches (i.e. letter releases).&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    If something is broken in a release a fixed version should be made
+	    available shortly afterwards (i.e. more letter releases more
+	    often)&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    We need a way to get new binary compatible features into OpenSSL
+	    relatively quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    We don't want to have to maintain too many branches. This is likely
+	    to include a timescale for the EOL of version 0.9.8&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    We need a way to refactor code and make necessary binary
+	    incompatible changes, deprecating APIs etc.&lt;/li&gt;
+	  &lt;/ol&gt;
+	  &lt;/del&gt;
+	  Objective met (2015): We have announced a
+	  &lt;a href=&quot;releasestrat.html&quot;&gt;release strategy&lt;/a&gt;
+	  which includes end-of-life and long-term support definitions.
+	  Also, our
+	  &lt;a href=&quot;secpolicy.html&quot;&gt;security policy&lt;/a&gt; has relevant
+	  information.
+	  &lt;/p&gt;
+
+	  &lt;h4&gt;Platform Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;
+	  Moving forward OpenSSL will adopt the following policy:&lt;/p&gt;
+	  &lt;ul&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    There will be a defined set of primary platforms. The primary
+	    platforms will be Linux and FreeBSD. A primary platform is one where
+	    most development occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    In addition there will be a list of secondary platforms which are
+	    supported by the development team.&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    Platform specific code will be moved out of the main codebase
+	    (removing overuse of &quot;ifdef&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    Legacy platforms that are unlikely to have wide deployment will be
+	    removed from the code.&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    Non-supported platforms requiring regular maintenance activities
+	    will eventually be removed from the code after first seeking
+	    community owners to support the platforms in platform specific
+	    repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
+	  &lt;/ul&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;
+	  Necessary criteria for a platform to be included in the secondary
+	  platform list includes:&lt;/p&gt;
+	  &lt;ul&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    Currency, i.e. a platform is widely deployed and in current use&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    Vendor support&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    Available to the dev team, i.e. the dev team have access to a
+	    suitable environment in which to test builds and deal with tickets
+	    and issues&lt;/li&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;
+	    Dev team ownership, i.e. at least one person on the team is willing
+	    to take some responsibility for a platform.&lt;/li&gt;
+	  &lt;/ul&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;
+	  In addition the secondary list will be as small as possible so as not
+	  to spread the development team too thinly.&lt;/p&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;
+	  The secondary platforms are still to be defined but will be based on
+	  the above criteria. For each primary/secondary platform, we should
+	  have, at least, a continuous integration box and a dev machine we can
+	  access for test/debug. We will seek support from the platform vendors
+	  or the community to provide access to these platforms. The secondary
+	  platform list will change over time, but an initial list will be
+	  produced within three months.&lt;/p&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;
+	  The Platform Strategy will be phased in over a period of time based
+	  on how quickly we can refactor the code.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+	  &lt;h4&gt;Security Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;
+	  &lt;del&gt;
+	    We will be documenting a security strategy which will define our
+	    policy on how we make security fixes, and what (if any)
+	    pre-notification of forthcoming security releases will be provided
+	    (and to whom) (Timescale: Within two months)
+	  &lt;/del&gt;
+	  &lt;br&gt;Objective met (7th September 2014): The OpenSSL security policy
+	  is available &lt;a href=&quot;secpolicy.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
+	  &lt;/p&gt;
+
+	  &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;forthcoming&quot;&gt;Forthcoming Features&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/up.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
+	  &lt;p&gt;The primary focus of effort will be on achieving the
+	  objectives detailed above, however we are evaluating the following
+	  new features.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+	  &lt;ul&gt;
+	    &lt;li&gt;IPv6 support&lt;/li&gt;
