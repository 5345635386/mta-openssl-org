+title: OpenSSL Strategic Architecture
+author: OpenSSL Management Committee (OMC)
+date: January, 2019
+---
+## Introduction
+
+This document outlines the OpenSSL strategic architecture. It will take
+multiple releases, starting from 3.0.0, to move the architecture from
+the current &quot;as-is&quot; (1.1.1), to the future &quot;to-be&quot; architecture.
+
+Numerous changes are anticipated in the to-be architecture. A migration
+path for handling the eventual transition will be provided. The OpenSSL
+3.0.0 release will have minimal impact to the vast majority of existing
+applications, almost all well-behaved applications will just need to be
+recompiled.
+
+The current functionality provided by the engine interface will be
+replaced over time via a provider interface. OpenSSL 3.0.0 will continue
+to support engines. The to-be architecture will not be fully realised
+until OpenSSL 4.0.0 at the earliest.
+
+## As-is architecture
+
+Currently, OpenSSL is split into four principal components:
+
+1.  libcrypto. This is the core library for providing implementations of
+    numerous cryptographic primitives. In addition it provides a set of
+    supporting services which are used by libssl and libcrypto, as well
+    as implementations of protocols such as CMS and OCSP.
+
+2.  Engine. The functionality of libcrypto can be extended through the
+    Engine API.
+
+    Typically engines are dynamically loadable modules that are registered
+    with libcrypto and use the available hooks to provide cryptographic
+    algorithm implementations. Usually these are alternative implementations
+    of algorithms already provided by libcrypto (e.g. to enable hardware
+    acceleration of the algorithm), but they may also include algorithms not
+    implemented in default OpenSSL (e.g. the GOST engine implements the GOST
+    algorithm family). Some engines are provided as part of the OpenSSL
+    distribution, and some are provided by external third parties (again,
+    GOST).
+
+3.  libssl. This library depends on libcrypto and implements the TLS and
+    DTLS protocols.
+
+4.  Applications. The applications are a set of command line tools that
+    use the underlying libssl and libcrypto components to provide a set
+    of cryptographic and other features such as:
+    a.  Key and parameter generation and inspection
+    b.  Certificate generation and inspection
+    c.  SSL/TLS test tools
+    d.  ASN.1 inspection
+    e.  Etc
+
+Currently, OpenSSL has the following characteristics:
+
+1.  EVP. The EVP (envelope) API level provides the high-level abstract
+    interface to cryptographic functionality separate from the concrete
+    implementation binding. Direct use of concrete cryptographic
+    algorithm implementations via interfaces other than the EVP layer is
+    discouraged. The EVP layer also provides composite operations, such
+    as signing and verifying. Certain composite operations are also
+    provided as an EVP-level operation (such as HMAC-SHA256). EVP also
+    allow use of cryptographic algorithms in an algorithm-agnostic
+    manner (e.g. EVP\_DigestSign works for both RSA and ECDSA
+    algorithms).
+
+2.  FIPS140 is not supported. FIPS140 it is only available in
+    OpenSSL-1.0.2 which predates the as-is architecture and is not API
+    or ABI compatible.
+
+### Conceptual Component View
+
+The existing architecture is a simple 4 level layering with the crypto
+layer at the bottom. The TLS layer depends on the crypto layer, and the
+applications depend on both the TLS and crypto layers.
+
+Note: the existence of a component in the diagram does not indicate that
+the component is a public API or intended for end-user direct access or
+usage.
+
+![](images/AsIsComponent.png)
+
+### Packaging View
+
+The components described above are packaged into libraries (libcrypto
+and libssl) and associated engine interfaces as well as an &quot;openssl&quot;
+command line executable for running the various applications. This is
+illustrated in the diagram below.
+
+![](images/AsIsPackaging.png)
+
+## To-be Architecture
+
+The to-be architecture has the following features:
+
+-   Core Services form the building blocks usable by applications and
+    providers. (e.g. BIO, X509, SECMEM, ASN1, etc).
+
+-   Providers implement cryptographic algorithms and supporting
+    services. A provider has implementations of one or more of the
+    following:
+
+    -   The cryptographic primitives for an algorithm, e.g. how to
+        encrypt/decrypt/sign/hash etc.
+    -   Serialisation for an algorithm, e.g. how to convert a private
+        key into a PEM file. Serialisation could be to or from formats
+        that are not currently supported.
+    -   Store loader back ends. OpenSSL currently has a store loader
+        that reads keys, parameters and other items from files.
+        Providers could have a loader to load from another location
+        (e.g. LDAP directory).
+
+    A Provider may be entirely self-contained or it may use services that
+    are provided by different providers or the Core Services. For example,
+    an application may use the cryptographic primitives for an algorithm
+    implemented by a hardware accelerated provider, but use the
+    serialisation services of a different provider in order to export keys
+    into PKCS\#12 format.
+
+    A default provider (which contains the core of the current OpenSSL
+    cryptographic algorithm implementations) will be &quot;built-in&quot; but other
+    providers will be able to be dynamically loadable at runtime.
+
+    Legacy provider module(s) will provide cryptographic implementations for
+    older algorithms (e.g., DES, MDC2, MD2, Blowfish, CAST). The OMC will
+    publish a policy for how and when algorithms are transitioned from the
+    default provider to the legacy provider.
+
+    A FIPS provider that embodies the OpenSSL FIPS Cryptographic Module will
+    be able to be dynamically loaded at runtime.
+
+-   The Core enables access to the services offered by providers to
+    applications (and other providers). Providers make methods available
+    to the Core. The Core is the mechanism via which concrete
+    implementations of where things such as algorithms are located.
+
+    The Core will implement a property based look-up feature for finding
+    algorithms, e.g. it might allow you find an algorithm where &quot;fips=true&quot;,
+    or &quot;keysize=128, constant\_time=true&quot;. The details of this will be
+    determined in later design documents.
+
+-   Protocol implementations. E.g. TLS, DTLS.
+
+The to-be architecture has the following characteristics:
+
+-   The EVP layer becomes a thin wrapper for services implemented in the
+    providers. Most calls are passed straight through with little/no
+    pre- or post-processing.
+
+-   New EVP APIs will be provided to find the implementation of an
+    algorithm in the Core to be used for any given EVP call.
+
+-   Information will be passed between the core library and the
+    providers in an implementation agnostic way.
+
+-   Legacy APIs (e.g. low level cryptographic APIs that do not go via
+    the EVP layer) will be deprecated. Note that there are legacy APIs
+    to non legacy algorithms (e.g. AES is a non-legacy algorithm but
+    AES\_encrypt is a legacy API).
+
+-   The OpenSSL FIPS Cryptographic Module will be implemented as a
+    dynamically loaded provider. It will be self-contained (i.e. can
+    only depend on system runtime libraries and services provided by the
+    Core).
+
+-   Other interfaces may also be transitioned to use the Core over time
+    (for example OSSL\_STORE might be considered for this).
+
+-   Engine usage will evolve to providers. &quot;*Bye-bye-Engines,
+    Hello-Providers&quot;.*
+
+### Conceptual Component View
+
+An overview of the conceptual components in the OpenSSL to-be
+architecture is as shown in the (pink nirvana) diagram below.
+
+Note: the existence of a component in the diagram does not indicate that
+the component is a public API or intended for end-user direct access or
+usage.
+
+![](images/ToBeComponent.png)
+
+The components shown here are as follows:
+
+-   Applications: Command line applications, e.g. ca, ciphers, cms, dgst
+    etc
+
+-   Protocols: Provides capabilities for communicating between endpoints
+    according to standard protocols
+
+    -   TLS Protocols: An implementation of all supported TLS/DTLS
+        protocols and supporting infrastructure such as:
+        -   SSL BIO: A BIO for communication using TLS
+        -   Statem: The TLS state machine
+        -   Record: The TLS record layer
+    -   Other Protocols
+        -   CMS: An implementation of the Cryptographic Message Syntax
+            standard
+        -   OCSP: An implementation of Online Certificate Status
+            Protocol
+        -   TS: An implementation of the Timestamp Protocol
+    -   Supporting Services: Components specifically designed to support
+        the implementation of protocol code
+        -   Packet: Internal component for reading protocol messages
+        -   Wpacket: Internal component for writing protocol messages
+
+-   Core: This is a fundamental component that connects requests for a
+    service (such as encryption) to a provider of that service. It
+    implements the ability for providers to register their services
+    along with the properties of those services. It also provides the
+    ability to locate a service given a set of properties that the
+    service must fulfil. For example, properties of an encryption
+    service might include &quot;aead&quot;, &quot;aes-gcm&quot;, &quot;fips&quot;,
+    &quot;security-bits=128&quot;, etc.
+
+-   Default Provider: Implements a set of default services that are
+    registered with the Core.
+
+    -   Supporting Services
+        -   Low Level Implementations: This is the set of components
+            that actually implement the cryptographic primitives.
+
+-   FIPS Provider: Implements a set of services that are FIPS validated
+    and made available to the Core. This includes the following
+    supporting services:
+
+    -   POST: Power On Self Test
+    -   KAT: Known Answer Tests
+    -   Integrity Check
+    -   Low Level Implementations: This is the set of components that
+        actually implement the cryptographic primitives (to meet the
+        FIPS-mandated self-contained requirement).
+
+-   Legacy Provider: Provides implementations of older algorithms that
+    will be exposed via EVP-level APIs.
+
+-   Third-Party Provider: Not part of the OpenSSL distribution. Third
+    Parties may implement their own providers.
+
+-   Common Services: these form the building blocks usable by
+    applications and providers. (e.g. BIO, X509, SECMEM, ASN1, etc).
+
+-   Legacy APIs. The &quot;low-level&quot; APIs. The &quot;legacy&quot; here refers to the
+    API, not the algorithm itself. For example, AES is not a legacy
+    algorithm but it has a legacy API (e.g. AES\_encrypt).
+
+### Packaging View
+
+The various components described in the conceptual component view above
+are physically packaged into:
+
+-   Executable application(s) for use by users
+
+-   Libraries for use by application(s)
+
+-   Dynamically loadable module(s) for use by the Core.
+
+![](images/ToBePackaging.png)
+
+The physical packages shown here are:
+
+-   Openssl executable. The command line application.
+
+-   Libssl. This contains everything directly related to TLS and DTLS.
+    Its contents will be largely the same as libssl in the as-is
+    architecture. Note that some supporting services will be moved to
+    libcrypto.
+
+-   Libcrypto. This library contains the following components:
+
+    -   Implementations of the core services such as: X509, ASN1, EVP,
+        OSSL\_STORE etc
+    -   The Core
+    -   Protocols not related to TLS or DTLS
+    -   Protocol supporting services (e.g. Packet and Wpacket)
+    -   The default provider containing implementations of all the
+        default algorithms
+
+-   Libcrypto-legacy. Provides the legacy &quot;low-level&quot; APIs.
+    Implementations of the algorithms for these APIS may come from any
+    provider.
+
+-   FIPS module. This contains the FIPS Provider that implements a set
+    of services that are FIPS validated and are registered with the
+    Core.
+
+-   Legacy module. This contains the legacy provider.

+Converting word processing files from Google Docs to Markdown
+=============================================================
+
+Converting documents from Google Docs to anything other than what you
+get with 'Files'-&gt;'Download as' or using an add-on is a bit of an
+adventure.  All of them come with quirks.
+
+Downloading and converting with pandoc
+--------------------------------------
+
+For simple documents, [pandoc](<A HREF="https://pandoc.org/">https://pandoc.org/</A>) turns out to be
+versatile enough to do a decent job that only requires small amounts
+of post processing.
+
+Experiments have shown that to convert a Google Docs wordprocessing
+document to Markdown with pandoc, a download in ODT format gives the
+cleanest results.  It still requires a little bit of editing, of which
+some can be automated, using this script:
+
+``` shell
+#! /bin/sh
+
+for f in &quot;$@&quot;; do
+    b=`basename &quot;$f&quot; .odt`
+    if [ &quot;$f&quot; != &quot;$b&quot; ]; then
+        bns=`echo &quot;$b&quot; | sed -e 's|  *||g'`
+        pandoc -t markdown --atx-headers --extract-media=media &quot;$f&quot; | perl -p -e '
+BEGIN { $/ = &quot;&quot;; }
+s|^\[\]\{#anchor-\d+\}|#!# |;
+s|(\n\s*)&gt; |$1|g;
+' &gt; &quot;$bns.md&quot;
+        echo &quot;'$bns.md' produced, make sure to edit the title page and the headings&quot;
+    fi
+done
+```
+
+When a Markdown file has been produced, a litte bit of editing is
+required.  A required thing is to look for all lines starting with
+`#!#` and replace them with an appropriate number of `#` characters,
+depending on the original heading's level.  ATX format headings are
+used, since they allow more than 2 heading levels.
+
+Try rendering the Markdown file using bin/md-to-html5, have a look at
+the result.  If you're satisfied, commit the Markdown file and images,
+and make appropiate changes in the top Makefile.  If not, make changes
+in the Markdown file and try again.
+
+Using an add-on in Google Docs and using the result
+---------------------------------------------------
+
+Unfortunately, it seems that there are things where Pandoc loses track
+of what it's doing.  I have not analyzed if it's a pandoc bug or if
+the ODT input was bad.  Also, pandoc isn't very good at recognising
+code sections.
+
+The other option is to use an add-on in Google Docs.  I've played with
+[gd2md](<A HREF="https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki">https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki</A>) with fairly
+satisfactory results.
+
+Things to be wary of with gd2md are:
+
+-   It doesn't make a difference between ordered lists with numbers
+    and ordered lists with letters, it makes them all numbered items.
+-   It sometimes doesn't convert simple things, like headings, and
+    leaves them as HTML
+-   It sometimes leaves code as explicit HTML wrapped with \&lt;code\&gt;
+-   It leaves tables in HTML form
+-   You have to provide the images yourself
+-   Internal links to bookmarks and headings are sometimes left with
+    no corresponding anchor
+
+All these things need to be looked after and edited into markdown.
+
+Try rendering the Markdown file using bin/md-to-html5, have a look at
+the result.  If you're satisfied, commit the Markdown file and images,
+and make appropiate changes in the top Makefile.  If not, make changes
+in the Markdown file and try again.
