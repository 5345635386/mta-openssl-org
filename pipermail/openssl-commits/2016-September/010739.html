    Avoid KCI attack for GOST
    
    Russian GOST ciphersuites are vulnerable to the KCI attack because they use
    long-term keys to establish the connection when ssl client authorization is
    on. This change brings the GOST implementation into line with the latest
    specs in order to avoid the attack. It should not break backwards
    compatibility.

    Fix a mem leak in NPN handling
    
    If a server sent multiple NPN extensions in a single ClientHello then a
    mem leak can occur. This will only happen where the client has requested
    NPN in the first place. It does not occur during renegotiation. Therefore
    the maximum that could be leaked in a single connection with a malicious
    server is 64k (the maximum size of the ServerHello extensions section). As
    this is client side, only occurs if NPN has been requested and does not
    occur during renegotiation this is unlikely to be exploitable.
    
    Issue reported by Shi Lei.

    Fix OCSP Status Request extension unbounded memory growth
    
    A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request
    extension. If that client continually requests renegotiation,
    sending a large OCSP Status Request extension each time, then there will
    be unbounded memory growth on the server. This will eventually lead to a
    Denial Of Service attack through memory exhaustion. Servers with a
    default configuration are vulnerable even if they do not support OCSP.
    Builds using the &quot;no-ocsp&quot; build time option are not affected.
    
    I have also checked other extensions to see if they suffer from a similar
    problem but I could not find any other issues.

+     extension. If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a
+     large OCSP Status Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded
+     memory growth on the server. This will eventually lead to a Denial Of

+
+     This issue was reported to OpenSSL by Shi Lei (Gear Team, Qihoo 360 Inc.)
+     (CVE-2016-6304)
+     [Matt Caswell]
+
+  *) In order to mitigate the SWEET32 attack, the DES ciphers were moved from
+     HIGH to MEDIUM.
+
+     This issue was reported to OpenSSL Karthikeyan Bhargavan and Gaetan
+     Leurent (INRIA)
+     (CVE-2016-2183)
      [Rich Salz]
 
+  *) OOB write in MDC2_Update()
+
+     An overflow can occur in MDC2_Update() either if called directly or
+     through the EVP_DigestUpdate() function using MDC2. If an attacker
+     is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous
+     call to EVP_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check
+     can overflow resulting in a heap corruption.
+
+     The amount of data needed is comparable to SIZE_MAX which is impractical
+     on most platforms.
+
+     This issue was reported to OpenSSL by Shi Lei (Gear Team, Qihoo 360 Inc.)
+     (CVE-2016-6303)
+     [Stephen Henson]
+
+  *) Malformed SHA512 ticket DoS
+
+     If a server uses SHA512 for TLS session ticket HMAC it is vulnerable to a
+     DoS attack where a malformed ticket will result in an OOB read which will
+     ultimately crash.
+
+     The use of SHA512 in TLS session tickets is comparatively rare as it requires
+     a custom server callback and ticket lookup mechanism.
+
+     This issue was reported to OpenSSL by Shi Lei (Gear Team, Qihoo 360 Inc.)
+     (CVE-2016-6302)
+     [Stephen Henson]
+
+  *) OOB write in BN_bn2dec()
+
+     The function BN_bn2dec() does not check the return value of BN_div_word().
+     This can cause an OOB write if an application uses this function with an
+     overly large BIGNUM. This could be a problem if an overly large certificate
+     or CRL is printed out from an untrusted source. TLS is not affected because
+     record limits will reject an oversized certificate before it is parsed.
+
+     This issue was reported to OpenSSL by Shi Lei (Gear Team, Qihoo 360 Inc.)
+     (CVE-2016-2182)
+     [Stephen Henson]
+
+  *) OOB read in TS_OBJ_print_bio()
+
+     The function TS_OBJ_print_bio() misuses OBJ_obj2txt(): the return value is
+     the total length the OID text representation would use and not the amount
+     of data written. This will result in OOB reads when large OIDs are
+     presented.
+
+     This issue was reported to OpenSSL by Shi Lei (Gear Team, Qihoo 360 Inc.)
+     (CVE-2016-2180)
+     [Stephen Henson]
+
+  *) Pointer arithmetic undefined behaviour
+
+     Avoid some undefined pointer arithmetic
+
+     A common idiom in the codebase is to check limits in the following manner:
+     &quot;p + len &gt; limit&quot;
+
+     Where &quot;p&quot; points to some malloc'd data of SIZE bytes and
+     limit == p + SIZE
+
+     &quot;len&quot; here could be from some externally supplied data (e.g. from a TLS
+     message).
+
+     The rules of C pointer arithmetic are such that &quot;p + len&quot; is only well
+     defined where len &lt;= SIZE. Therefore the above idiom is actually
+     undefined behaviour.
+
+     For example this could cause problems if some malloc implementation
+     provides an address for &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;p + len&quot; actually overflows for
+     values of len that are too big and therefore p + len &lt; limit.
+
+     This issue was reported to OpenSSL by Guido Vranken
+     (CVE-2016-2177)
+     [Matt Caswell]
+
+  *) Constant time flag not preserved in DSA signing
+
+     Operations in the DSA signing algorithm should run in constant time in
+     order to avoid side channel attacks. A flaw in the OpenSSL DSA
+     implementation means that a non-constant time codepath is followed for
+     certain operations. This has been demonstrated through a cache-timing
+     attack to be sufficient for an attacker to recover the private DSA key.
+
+     This issue was reported by C&#233;sar Pereida (Aalto University), Billy Brumley
+     (Tampere University of Technology), and Yuval Yarom (The University of
+     Adelaide and NICTA).
+     (CVE-2016-2178)
+     [C&#233;sar Pereida]
+
+  *) DTLS buffered message DoS
+
+     In a DTLS connection where handshake messages are delivered out-of-order
+     those messages that OpenSSL is not yet ready to process will be buffered
+     for later use. Under certain circumstances, a flaw in the logic means that
+     those messages do not get removed from the buffer even though the handshake
+     has been completed. An attacker could force up to approx. 15 messages to
+     remain in the buffer when they are no longer required. These messages will
+     be cleared when the DTLS connection is closed. The default maximum size for
+     a message is 100k. Therefore the attacker could force an additional 1500k
+     to be consumed per connection. By opening many simulataneous connections an
+     attacker could cause a DoS attack through memory exhaustion.
+
+     This issue was reported to OpenSSL by Quan Luo.
+     (CVE-2016-2179)
+     [Matt Caswell]
+
+  *) DTLS replay protection DoS
+
+     A flaw in the DTLS replay attack protection mechanism means that records
+     that arrive for future epochs update the replay protection &quot;window&quot; before
+     the MAC for the record has been validated. This could be exploited by an
+     attacker by sending a record for the next epoch (which does not have to
+     decrypt or have a valid MAC), with a very large sequence number. This means
+     that all subsequent legitimate packets are dropped causing a denial of
+     service for a specific DTLS connection.
+
+     This issue was reported to OpenSSL by the OCAP audit team.
+     (CVE-2016-2181)
+     [Matt Caswell]
+
+  *) Certificate message OOB reads
+
+     In OpenSSL 1.0.2 and earlier some missing message length checks can result
+     in OOB reads of up to 2 bytes beyond an allocated buffer. There is a
+     theoretical DoS risk but this has not been observed in practice on common
+     platforms.
+
+     The messages affected are client certificate, client certificate request
+     and server certificate. As a result the attack can only be performed
+     against a client or a server which enables client authentication.
+
+     This issue was reported to OpenSSL by Shi Lei (Gear Team, Qihoo 360 Inc.)
+     (CVE-2016-6306)
+     [Stephen Henson]
