+L&lt;ASYNC_start_job(3)&gt;. An B&lt;ASYNC_WAIT_CTX&gt; object represents an asynchronous

 this would have a one-to-one correspondence with an SSL connection.
 
-Application code must create an ASYNC_WAIT_CTX using the ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_new()
+Application code must create an B&lt;ASYNC_WAIT_CTX&gt; using the ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_new()
 function prior to calling ASYNC_start_job() (see L&lt;ASYNC_start_job(3)&gt;). When
-the job is started it is associated with the ASYNC_WAIT_CTX for the duration of
-that job. An ASYNC_WAIT_CTX should only be used for one ASYNC_JOB at any one
-time, but can be reused after an ASYNC_JOB has finished for a subsequent
-ASYNC_JOB. When the session is complete (e.g. the SSL connection is closed),

-ASYNC_WAIT_CTXs can have &quot;wait&quot; file descriptors associated with them. Calling
-ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_all_fds() and passing in a pointer to an ASYNC_WAIT_CTX in
-the B&lt;ctx&gt; parameter will return the wait file descriptors associated with that
-job in B&lt;*fd&gt;. The number of file descriptors returned will be stored in
-B&lt;*numfds&gt;. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that sufficient memory

-ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_all_fds() with a NULL B&lt;fd&gt; value will return no file

-typically expected to call this function twice: once to get the number of fds,

 The function ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_changed_fds() can be used to detect if any fds
-have changed since the last call time ASYNC_start_job() returned an ASYNC_PAUSE
-result (or since the ASYNC_WAIT_CTX was created if no ASYNC_PAUSE result has
-been received). The B&lt;numaddfds&gt; and B&lt;numdelfds&gt; parameters will be populated

 will be populated with the list of added and deleted fds respectively. Similarly
 to ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_get_all_fds() either of these can be NULL, but if they are not
 NULL then the caller is responsible for ensuring sufficient memory is allocated.
 
 Implementors of async aware code (e.g. engines) are encouraged to return a

 user code exits per-thread resources need to be cleaned up. This will normally
 occur automatically (see L&lt;OPENSSL_init_crypto(3)&gt;) but may be explicitly
 initiated by using ASYNC_cleanup_thread(). No asynchronous jobs must be
 outstanding for the thread when ASYNC_cleanup_thread() is called. Failing to
 ensure this will result in memory leaks.

 SSL_get_all_async_fds() returns a list of file descriptor which can be used in a
 call to select() or poll() to determine whether the current asynchronous
 operation has completed or not. A completed operation will result in data
 appearing as &quot;read ready&quot; on the file descriptor (no actual data should be read
-from the file descriptor). This function should only be called if the SSL object

+SSL_CTX_set_async_callback() sets an asynchronous callback function. All B&lt;SSL&gt;

 cryptography operation to notify the application to resume the paused work flow.
 
 SSL_CTX_set_async_callback_arg() sets the callback argument.
 
 SSL_set_async_callback() allows an application to set a callback in an
-asynchronous SSL object, so that when an engine completes a cryptography
+asynchronous B&lt;SSL&gt; object, so that when an engine completes a cryptography
 operation, the callback will be called to notify the application to resume the

 SSL_get_async_status() returns the engine status. This function facilitates the
 communication from the engine to the application. During an SSL session,
 cryptographic operations are dispatched to an engine. The engine status is very
 useful for an application to know if the operation has been successfully
 dispatched. If the engine does not support this additional callback method,
-&quot;ASYNC_STATUS_UNSUPPORTED&quot; will be returned. See ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_set_status() for
-a description of all of the status values.
