commit f619622715af3904ee1d6e0affd563f8ed799ff0
Author: Richard Levitte &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">levitte at openssl.org</A>&gt;

    VMS: stop trying to build shared libraries from static ones
    
    The possibility to do this was killed when we started producing object
    file names with encoded intention (and possibly different builds), and
    leads to build errors.
    
    With that, 'libobj2shlib' is renamed to 'obj2shlib' to reflect this
    design change.  The old name is still used if the new one isn't
    available, for the sake of backward compatibility.
