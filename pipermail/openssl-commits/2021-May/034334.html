    Test new SSL_new_session_ticket() functionality
    
    Now that we can become &quot;in init&quot; directly after the call, test the
    various scenarios where explicit SSL_do_handshake() calls can come
    into play.

    Let SSL_new_session_ticket() enter init immediately
    
    The initial implementation always deferred the generation of the
    requested ticket(s) until the next application write, but this
    is not a great fit for what it actually does, architecturally wise.
    A request to send a session ticket means entering back into the
    handshake state machine (or &quot;in init&quot;, as it's known in the
    implementation).  The state machine transition is not something that
    only occurs at an application-data write, and in general could occur at
    any time.  The only constraint is that we can't enter &quot;init&quot; while in
    the middle of writing application data.  In such cases we will need to
    wait until the next TLS record boundary to enter the state machine,
    as is currently done.
    
    However, there is no reason why we cannot enter the handshake state
    machine immediately in SSL_new_session_ticket() if there are no
    application writes pending.  Doing so provides a cleaner API surface to
    the application, as then calling SSL_do_handshake() suffices to drive
    the actual ticket generation.  In the previous state of affairs a dummy
    zero-length SSL_write() would be needed to trigger the ticket
    generation, which is a logical mismatch in the type of operation being
    performed.
    
    This commit should only change whether SSL_do_handshake() vs zero-length
    SSL_write() is needed to immediately generate a ticket after the
    SSL_new_session_ticket() call -- the default behavior is still to defer
    the actual write until there is other application data to write, unless
    the application requests otherwise.
