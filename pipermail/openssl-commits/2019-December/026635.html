commit 70947eca9c26af584ac69467a6f5fcd1a2fa6b5a
Author: Matt Caswell &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-commits.html">matt at openssl.org</A>&gt;

    Update the by-laws to introduce the OTC concept
    
    We split the responsibilities of the current OMC into two different
    groups - the OMC and the OTC (OpenSSL Technical Committee). The OMC still
    retains its overall management function but the OTC becomes responsible
    for technical decision making.
    
    PR reviews will then require approval from an OTC member instead of an
    OMC member.

+          &lt;p&gt;Membership of the OTC is by invitation only from the OMC.

+          OTC members may be OMC members and in which case all rules that apply to OMC members
+          also apply.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;The OTC makes technical decisions on behalf of the project based on
+          requirements specified by the OMC. In order to have
+          a valid voice on the OTC, members must be actively contributing to the
+          technical aspects of the project. Note that there are many ways to contribute to the project
+          but the ones that count in order to participate in the OTC
+          decision-making process are the ones listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;OTC members may become inactive. In order to remain active a member
+          must, in any calendar quarter, contribute by:&lt;/p&gt;
+          &lt;ul&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;a) Having authored, or been recorded as a reviewer of, at least
+            one commit made to any OpenSSL repository (including non-code based
+            ones) and&lt;/li&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;b) vote in at least two-thirds of the OTC votes closed in the
+            first two months of the quarter and the last month of the preceding
+            quarter and &lt;/li&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;c) maintain committer status.&lt;/li&gt;
+          &lt;/ul&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;The above rules will be applied at the beginning of each calender
+          quarter. It does not apply if the OTC member was first appointed, or
+          became active again during the previous calendar quarter. The voting
+          requirement only includes those votes after the time the member joined
+          or was made active again.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;If an OTC member remains inactive for one calendar quarter then
+          they will no longer be considered an OTC member.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;An OTC member can declare themselves inactive, leave the OTC, or
+          leave the project entirely. This does not require a vote.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;An inactive OTC member can propose a vote that the OTC declare them
+          active again. Inactive OTC members cannot vote but can propose issues
+          to vote on and participate in discussions. They retain access to OTC
+          internal resources.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;voting&quot;&gt;OTC Voting Procedures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;A vote will pass if it has had a vote registered from
+          a majority of active OTC members and has had more votes registered in
+          favour than votes registered against.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;Only active OTC members may vote. A registered vote is a vote in
+          favour, a vote against, or an abstention.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;Any OTC member (active or inactive) can propose a vote.
+          Each vote must include a closing date which must be between seven and fourteen
+          calendar days after the start of the vote. &lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;In exceptional cases, the closing date
+          could be less than seven calendar days; for example, a critical issue
+          that needs rapid action. A critical issue is hard to define precisely
+          but would include cases where a security fix is needed and the details
+          will soon be made public. At least one other active OTC member besides
+          the proposer needs to agree to the shorter timescale.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;A vote closes on its specified date. In addition, any active OTC
+          member can declare a vote closed once the number of uncast votes could
+          not affect the outcome. Any active OTC member may change their vote up
+          until the vote is closed. No vote already cast can be changed after
+          the vote is closed. Votes may continue to be cast and recorded after a
+          vote is closed up until fourteen days after the start of the vote.
+          These votes will count for the purposes of determining OTC member
+          activity, but will otherwise not affect the outcome of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;All votes and their outcomes should be recorded and available to

+          The majority of the activity of the OTC will take place in public.
+          Non-public discussions or votes shall only occur for issues such as:
+          &lt;ul&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;pre-disclosure security problems&lt;/li&gt;

+          from the project. A leave of absence from the OMC, OTC or committer shall
+          suspend inactivity determination for the specified role. All access to
+          OMC, OTC or committer resources shall be suspended (disabled) and the OMC
+          or OTC member shall be excluded from voting and the committer shall be excluded
+          from reviewing or approving source changes. On return from a leave of
+          absence, the OMC or OTC member or committer will be deemed to have become active
+          as of the date of return.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;All of the following criteria must be met in order to qualify as a
+          leave of absence:&lt;/p&gt;
+          &lt;ul&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;a) the member must request via email to the OMC a leave of
+                   absence at least one week in advance of the requested
+                   period of leave;&lt;/li&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;b) only one leave of absence is permitted per calendar year;&lt;/li&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;c) the leave of absence must specify the date of return from
+                   the leave of absence; &lt;/li&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;d) the length of the leave of absence shall be a minimum of one calendar
+                   month and shall not exceed three calendar months (one quarter); and &lt;/li&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;e) the leave of absence applies to all the roles within the
+                   project (i.e. OMC, OTC and committer if all three roles apply).&lt;/li&gt;
+          &lt;/ul&gt;
+
+          &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Bylaws Update History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
+          &lt;p&gt;
+          The following changes have been made since the bylaws were first
+          issued 13-February-2017.
+          &lt;/p&gt;
+          &lt;ul&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;21-November-2019.
+            Added &lt;i&gt;OTC&lt;/i&gt;. and other related changes.&lt;/li&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;20-December-2017.
+            Added &lt;i&gt;Leave of absence&lt;/i&gt; section.&lt;/li&gt;
+          &lt;/ul&gt;
