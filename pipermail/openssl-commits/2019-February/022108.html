    OpenSSL::Util::Pod: allow slashes in names
    
    The names in the NAME section may describe headers, which contain a slash
    for OpenSSL headers.  We deal with that by converting slashes to dashes
    for the file names.

+=head1 NAME
+
+OSSL_PARAM - a structure to pass or request object parameters
+
+=head1 SYNOPSIS
+
+ #include &lt;openssl/core.h&gt;
+
+ typedef struct ossl_param_st OSSL_PARAM;
+ struct ossl_param_st {
+     const char *key;             /* the name of the parameter */
+     unsigned char data_type;     /* declare what kind of content is in buffer */
+     void *buffer;                /* value being passed in or out */
+     size_t buffer_size;          /* buffer size */
+     size_t *return_size;         /* OPTIONAL: address to content size */
+ };
+
+=head1 DESCRIPTION
+
+C&lt;OSSL_PARAM&gt; is a type that allows passing arbitrary data for some
+object between two parties that have no or very little shared
+knowledge about their respective internal structures for that object.
+
+A typical usage example could be an application that wants to set some
+parameters for an object, or wants to find out some parameters of an
+object.
+
+Arrays of this type can be used for two purposes:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item *
+
+Setting parameters for some object.
+The caller sets up the C&lt;OSSL_PARAM&gt; array and calls some function
+(the I&lt;setter&gt;) that has intimate knowledge about the object that can
+take the data from the C&lt;OSSL_PARAM&gt; array and assign them in a
+suitable form for the internal structure of the object.
+
+=item *
+
+Request parameters of some object.
+The caller (the I&lt;requestor&gt;) sets up the C&lt;OSSL_PARAM&gt; array and
+calls some function (the I&lt;responder&gt;) that has intimate knowledge
+about the object, which can take the internal data of the object and
+copy (possibly convert) that to the buffers prepared by the
+I&lt;requestor&gt;.
+
+=back
+
+=head2 C&lt;OSSL_PARAM&gt; fields
+
+=over 4
+
+=item C&lt;key&gt;
+
+The identity of the parameter in the form of a string.
+
+=item C&lt;data_type&gt;
+
+=for comment It's still debated if this field should be present, or if
+the type should always be implied by how it's used.
+Either way, these data types will have to be passed together with the
+names as an array of OSSL_ITEM, for discovery purposes.
+
+The C&lt;data_type&gt; is a value that describes the type and organization of
+the data.
+See L&lt;/Supported types&gt; below for a description of the types.
+
+=item C&lt;buffer&gt;
+
+=item C&lt;buffer_size&gt;
+
+C&lt;buffer&gt; is a pointer to the memory where the parameter data is (when
+setting parameters) or shall (when requesting parameters) be stored,
+and C&lt;buffer_size&gt; is its size in bytes.
+The organization of the data depends on the parameter type and flag.
+
+=item C&lt;return_size&gt;
+
+When an array of C&lt;OSSL_PARAM&gt; is used to request data, the
+I&lt;responder&gt; must set this field to indicate the actual size of the
+parameter data.
+In case the C&lt;buffer_size&gt; is too small for the data, the I&lt;responder&gt;
+must still set this field to indicate the minimum buffer size
+required.
+
+=back
+
+B&lt;NOTE:&gt;
+
+The key names and associated types are defined by the entity that
+offers these parameters, i.e. names for parameters provided by the
+OpenSSL libraries are defined by the libraries, and names for
+parameters provided by providers are defined by those providers,
+except for the pointer form of strings (see data type descriptions
+below).
+Entities that want to set or request parameters need to know what
+those keys are and of what type, any functionality between those two
+entities should remain oblivious and just pass the C&lt;OSSL_PARAM&gt; array
+along.
+
+=head2 Supported types
+
+The C&lt;data_type&gt; field can be one of the following types:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item C&lt;OSSL_PARAM_INTEGER&gt;
+
+=item C&lt;OSSL_PARAM_UNSIGNED_INTEGER&gt;
+
+The parameter data is an integer (signed or unsigned) of arbitrary
+length, organized in native form, i.e. most significant byte first on
+Big-Endian systems, and least significant byte first on Little-Endian
+systems.
+
+=item C&lt;OSSL_PARAM_REAL&gt;
+
+=for comment It's still debated if we need this or not.
+
+The parameter data is a floating point value in native form.
+
+=item C&lt;OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING&gt;
+
+The parameter data is a printable string.
+
+=item C&lt;OSSL_PARAM_OCTET_STRING&gt;
+
+The parameter data is an arbitrary string of bytes.
+
+=back
+
+Additionally, this flag can be added to any type:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item C&lt;OSSL_PARAM_POINTER_FLAG&gt;
+
+With this flag, C&lt;buffer&gt; doesn't point directly at the data, but at a
+pointer that points at the data.
+
+This can be used to indicate that constant data is or will be passed,
+and there is therefore no need to copy the data that is passed, just
+the pointer to it.
+
+If an C&lt;OSSL_PARAM&gt; with this flag set is used to set a parameter,
+C&lt;buffer_size&gt; must be set to the size of the data, not the size of
+the pointer to the data.
+
+If this C&lt;OSSL_PARAM&gt; is used in a parameter request, C&lt;buffer_size&gt;
+is not relevant.
+However, the I&lt;responder&gt; will set C&lt;*return_size&gt; to the size of the
+data (again, not the size of the pointer to the data).
+
+Note that the use of this flag is B&lt;fragile&gt; and can only be safely
+used for data that remains constant and in a constant location for a
+long enough duration (such as the life-time of the entity that
+offers these parameters).
+
+=back
+
+For convenience, these types are provided:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item C&lt;OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING_PTR&gt;
+
+=item C&lt;OSSL_PARAM_OCTET_STRING_PTR&gt;
+
+These are combinations of C&lt;OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING&gt; as well as
+C&lt;OSSL_PARAM_OCTET_STRING&gt; with C&lt;OSSL_PARAM_POINTER_FLAG&gt;.
+
+=back
+
+=head1 NOTES
+
+Both when setting and requesting parameters, the functions that are
+called will have to decide what is and what is not an error.
+The recommended behaviour is:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item *
+
+Keys that a I&lt;setter&gt; or I&lt;responder&gt; doesn't recognise should simply
+be ignored.
+That in itself isn't an error.
+
+=item *
+
+If the keys that a called I&lt;setter&gt; recognises form a consistent
+enough set of data, that call should succeed.
+
+=item *
+
+A I&lt;responder&gt; must never change the fields of an C&lt;OSSL_PARAM&gt;, it
+may only change the contents of the buffers that C&lt;buffer&gt; and
+C&lt;return_size&gt; point at.
+
+=item *
+
+If the data type for a key that it's associated with is incorrect,
+the called function may return an error.
+
+The called function may also try to convert the data to a suitable
+form (for example, it's plausible to pass a large number as an octet
+string, so even though a given key is defined as an
+C&lt;OSSL_PARAM_UNSIGNED_INTEGER&gt;, is plausible to pass the value as an
+C&lt;OSSL_PARAM_OCTET_STRING&gt;), but this is in no way mandatory.
+
+=item *
+
+If a I&lt;responder&gt; finds that some buffers are too small for the
+requested data, it must set C&lt;*return_size&gt; for each such
+C&lt;OSSL_PARAM&gt; item to the required size, and eventually return an
+error.

+=head1 EXAMPLES
+
+A couple of examples to just show how C&lt;OSSL_PARAM&gt; arrays could be
+set up.
+
+=head3 Example 1
+
+This example is for setting parameters on some object:
+
+    #include &lt;openssl/core.h&gt;
+
+    const char *foo = &quot;some string&quot;;
+    size_t foo_l = strlen(foo) + 1;
+    const char bar[] = &quot;some other string&quot;;
+    const OSSL_PARAM set[] = {
+        { &quot;foo&quot;, OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING_PTR, &amp;foo, foo_l, NULL },
+        { &quot;bar&quot;, OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING, &amp;bar, sizeof(bar), NULL },
+        { NULL, 0, NULL, 0, NULL }
+    };
+
+=head3 Example 2
+
+This example is for requesting parameters on some object:
+
+    const char *foo = NULL;
+    size_t foo_l;
+    char bar[1024];
+    size_t bar_l;
+    const OSSL_PARAM request[] = {
+        { &quot;foo&quot;, OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING_PTR, &amp;foo, 0 /*irrelevant*/, &amp;foo_l },
+        { &quot;bar&quot;, OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING, &amp;bar, sizeof(bar), &amp;bar_l },
+        { NULL, 0, NULL, 0, NULL }
+    };
+
+A I&lt;responder&gt; that receives this array (as C&lt;params&gt; in this example)
+could fill in the parameters like this:
+
+    /* const OSSL_PARAM *params */
+
+    int i;
+
+    for (i = 0; params[i].key != NULL; i++) {
+        if (strcmp(params[i].key, &quot;foo&quot;) == 0) {
+            *(char **)params[i].buffer = &quot;foo value&quot;;
+            *params[i].return_size = 10; /* size of &quot;foo value&quot; */
+        } else if (strcmp(params[i].key, &quot;bar&quot;) == 0) {
+            memcpy(params[1].buffer, &quot;bar value&quot;, 10);
+            *params[1].return_size = 10; /* size of &quot;bar value&quot; */
+        }
+        /* Ignore stuff we don't know */
+    }

+=head1 NAME
+
+openssl/core.h - OpenSSL Core types
+
+=head1 SYNOPSIS
+
+ #include &lt;openssl/core.h&gt;
+
+=head1 DESCRIPTION
+
+The &lt;openssl/core.h&gt; header file defines a number of public types that
+are used to communicate between the OpenSSL libraries and
+implementation providers.
+These types are designed to minimise the need for intimate knowledge
+of internal structures between the OpenSSL libraries and the providers.
+
+The types are:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item C&lt;OSSL_DISPATCH&gt;
+
+This type is a tuple of function identity and function pointer.
+Arrays of this type are passed between the OpenSSL libraries and the
+providers to describe what functionality one side provides to the
+other.
+Arrays of this type must be terminated with a tuple having function
+identity zero and function pointer C&lt;NULL&gt;.
+
+The available function identities and corresponding function
+signatures are defined by L&lt;openssl-core_numbers.h(7)&gt;.
+
+Any function identity not recognised by the recipient of this type
+will be ignored.
+This ensures that providers built with one OpenSSL version in mind
+will work together with any other OpenSSL version that supports this
+mechanism.
+
+=item C&lt;OSSL_ITEM&gt;
+
+This type is a tuple of integer and pointer.
+It's a generic type used as a generic descriptor, its exact meaning
+being defined by how it's used.
+Arrays of this type are passed between the OpenSSL libraries and the
+providers, and must be terminated with a tuple where the integer is
+zero and the pointer C&lt;NULL&gt;.
+
+=item C&lt;OSSL_ALGORITHM&gt;
+
+This type is a tuple of an algorithm name (string), a property
+definition (string) and a dispatch table (array of C&lt;OSSL_DISPATCH&gt;).
+Arrays of this type are passed on demand from the providers to the
+OpenSSL libraries to describe what algorithms the providers provide
+implementations of, and with what properties.
+Arrays of this type must be terminated with a tuple having function
+identity zero and function pointer C&lt;NULL&gt;.
+
+The algorithm names and property definitions are defined by the
+providers.
+
+=item C&lt;OSSL_PARAM&gt;
+
+This type is a structure that allows passing arbitrary object data
+between two parties that have no or very little shared knowledge about
+their respective internal structures for that object. 
+It's normally passed in arrays, where the array is terminated with an
+element where all fields are zero (for non-pointers) or C&lt;NULL&gt; (for
+pointers).
+
+These arrays can be used both to set parameters for some object, and
+to request parameters.
+
+C&lt;OSSL_PARAM&gt; is further described in L&lt;OSSL_PARAM(3)&gt;
