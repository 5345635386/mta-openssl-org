+OpenSSL Security Advisory [25 March 2021]
+=========================================
+
+CA certificate check bypass with X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT (CVE-2021-3450)
+========================================================================
+
+Severity: High
+
+The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the
+certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default.
+
+Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in
+the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added
+as an additional strict check.
+
+An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a
+previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA
+certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check
+that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates.
+
+If a &quot;purpose&quot; has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity
+for checks that the certificate is a valid CA.  All of the named &quot;purpose&quot;
+values implemented in libcrypto perform this check.  Therefore, where
+a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the
+strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and
+server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or
+removed by an application.
+
+In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the
+X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose
+for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server
+applications, override the default purpose.
+
+OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these
+versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k.
+
+OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.
+
+This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 18th March 2021 by Benjamin Kaduk
+from Akamai and was discovered by Xiang Ding and others at Akamai. The fix was
+developed by Tom&#225;&#353; Mr&#225;z.
+
+
+NULL pointer deref in signature_algorithms processing (CVE-2021-3449)
+=====================================================================
+
+Severity: High
+
+An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation
+ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits
+the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial
+ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL
+pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service
+attack.
+
+A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which
+is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this
+issue.
+
+All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions
+should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k.
+
+OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.
+
+This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 17th March 2021 by Nokia. The fix was
+developed by Peter K&#228;stle and Samuel Sapalski from Nokia.
+
+Note
+====
+
+OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Extended
+support is available for premium support customers:
+<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html">https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html</A>
+
+OpenSSL 1.1.0 is out of support and no longer receiving updates of any kind.
+The impact of these issues on OpenSSL 1.1.0 has not been analysed.
+
+Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1.
