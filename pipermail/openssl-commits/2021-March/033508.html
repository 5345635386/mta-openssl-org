 OpenSSL FIPS support
 ====================
 
-This release does not support a FIPS 140-2 validated module.
+This release of OpenSSL includes a cryptographic module that is intended to be
+FIPS 140-2 validated. The module is implemented as an OpenSSL provider. See
+the [README-PROVIDERS](README-PROVIDERS.md) file for further details about
+providers.
+
+Installing the FIPS module
+==========================
+
+Once OpenSSL has been built and installed you will need to take explicit steps
+to complete the installation of the FIPS module (if you wish to use it). The
+OpenSSL 3.0 FIPS support is in the form of the FIPS provider which, on Unix, is
+in a `fips.so` file. On Windows this will be called `fips.dll`. Following
+installation of OpenSSL 3.0 the default location for this file is
+`/usr/local/lib/ossl-modules/fips.so` on Unix or
+`C:\Program Files\OpenSSL\lib\ossl-modules\fips.dll` on Windows.
+
+To complete the installation you need to run the `fipsinstall` command line
+application. This does 2 things:
+
+- Runs the FIPS module self tests
+- Generates FIPS module config file output containing information about the
+module such as the self test status, and the module checksum.
+
+The FIPS module must have the self tests run, and the FIPS module config file
+output generated on every machine that it is to be used on. You must not copy
+the FIPS module config file output data from one machine to another.
+
+For example, to install the FIPS module to its default location on Unix:
+
+    $ openssl fipsinstall -out /usr/local/ssl/fipsmodule.cnf -module /usr/local/lib/ossl-modules/fips.so
+
+If you installed OpenSSL to a different location, you need to adjust the output
+and module path accordingly.
+
+
+Using the FIPS Module in applications
+=====================================
+
+There are a number of different ways that OpenSSL can be used in conjunction
+with the FIPS module. Which is the correct approach to use will depend on your
+own specific circumstances and what you are attempting to achieve. Note that the
+old functions `FIPS_mode()` and `FIPS_mode_set()` are no longer present so you
+must remove them from your application if you use them.
+
+Applications written to use the OpenSSL 3.0 FIPS module should not use any
+legacy APIs or features that avoid the FIPS module. Specifically this includes:
+
+- Low level cryptographic APIs (use the high level APIs, such as EVP, instead)
+- Engines
+- Any functions that create or modify custom &quot;METHODS&quot; (for example
+`EVP_MD_meth_new`, `EVP_CIPHER_meth_new`, `EVP_PKEY_meth_new`, `RSA_meth_new`,
+`EC_KEY_METHOD_new`, etc.)
+
+All of the above APIs are deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 - so a simple rule is to
+avoid using all deprecated functions.
+
+Making all applications use the FIPS module by default
+------------------------------------------------------
+
+One simple approach is to cause all applications that are using OpenSSL to only
+use the FIPS module for cryptographic algorithms by default.
+
+This approach can be done purely via configuration. As long as applications are
+built and linked against OpenSSL 3.0 and do not override the loading of the
+default config file or its settings then they can automatically start using the
+FIPS module without the need for any further code changes.
+
+To do this the default OpenSSL config file will have to be modified. The
+location of this config file will depend on the platform, and any options that
+were given during the build process. You can check the location of the config
+file by running this command:
+
+    $ openssl version -d
+    OPENSSLDIR: &quot;/usr/local/ssl&quot;
+
+Caution: Many Operating Systems install OpenSSL by default. It is a common error
+to not have the correct version of OpenSSL on your $PATH. Check that you are
+running an OpenSSL 3.0 version like this:
+
+    $ openssl version -v
+    OpenSSL 3.0.0-dev xx XXX xxxx (Library: OpenSSL 3.0.0-dev xx XXX xxxx)
+
+The OPENSSLDIR value above gives the directory name for where the default config
+file is stored. So in this case the default config file will be called
+`/usr/local/ssl/openssl.cnf`
+
+Edit the config file to add the following lines near the beginning:
+
+    openssl_conf = openssl_init
+
+    .include /usr/local/ssl/fipsmodule.cnf
+
+    [openssl_init]
+    providers = provider_sect
+
+    [provider_sect]
+    fips = fips_sect
+    base = base_sect
+
+    [base_sect]
+    activate = 1
+
+Obviously the include file location above should match the name of the FIPS
+module config file that you installed earlier.
+
+Any applications that use OpenSSL 3.0 and are started after these changes are
+made will start using only the FIPS module unless those applications take
+explicit steps to avoid this default behaviour. Note that this configuration
+also activates the &quot;base&quot; provider. The base provider does not include any
+cryptographic algorithms (and therefore does not impact the validation status of
+any cryptographic operations), but does include other supporting algorithms that
+may be required. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the FIPS module.
+
+This approach has the primary advantage that it is simple, and no code changes
+are required in applications in order to benefit from the FIPS module. There are
+some disadvantages to this approach:
+
+- You may not want all applications to use the FIPS module. It may be the case
+that some applications should and some should not.
+- If applications take explicit steps to not load the default config file or set
+different settings then this method will not work for them
+- The algorithms available in the FIPS module are a subset of the algorithms
+that are available in the default OpenSSL Provider. If those applications
+attempt to use any algorithms that are not present, then they will fail.
+- Usage of certain deprecated APIs avoids the use of the FIPS module. If any
+applications use those APIs then the FIPS module will not be used.
+
+Selectively making applications use the FIPS module by default
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+
+A variation on the above approach is to do the same thing on an individual
+application basis. The default OpenSSL config file depends on the compiled in
+value for OPENSSLDIR as described in the section above. However it is also
+possible to override the config file to be used via the `OPENSSL_CONF`
+environment variable. For example the following on Unix will cause the
+application to be executed with a non-standard config file location:
+
+    $ OPENSSL_CONF=/my/non-default/openssl.cnf myapplication
+
+Using this mechanism you can control which config file is loaded (and hence
+whether the FIPS module is loaded) on an application by application basis.
+
+This removes the disadvantage listed above that you may not want all
+applications to use the FIPS module. All the other advantages and disadvantages
+still apply.
+
+Programmatically loading the FIPS module (default library context)
+------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Applications may choose to load the FIPS provider explicitly rather than relying
+on config to do this. The config file is still necessary in order to hold the
+FIPS module config data (such as its self test status and integrity data). But
+in this case we do not automatically activate the FIPS provider via that config
+file.
+
+To do things this way configure as per the section &quot;Making all applications use
+the FIPS module by default&quot; above, but edit the `fipsmodule.cnf` file to remove
+or comment out the line which says `activate = 1` (note that setting this value
+to 0 is **not** sufficient). This means all the required config information will
+be available to load the FIPS module, but it is not actually automatically
+loaded when the application starts. The FIPS provider can then be loaded
+programmatically like this:
+
+    #include &lt;openssl/provider.h&gt;
+
+    int main(void)
+    {
+        OSSL_PROVIDER *fips;
+        OSSL_PROVIDER *base;
+
+        fips = OSSL_PROVIDER_load(NULL, &quot;fips&quot;);
+        if (fips == NULL) {
+            printf(&quot;Failed to load FIPS provider\n&quot;);
+            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
+        }
+        base = OSSL_PROVIDER_load(NULL, &quot;base&quot;);
+        if (base == NULL) {
+            OSSL_PROVIDER_unload(fips);
+            printf(&quot;Failed to load base provider\n&quot;);
+            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
+        }
+
+        /* Rest of application */
+
+        OSSL_PROVIDER_unload(base);
+        OSSL_PROVIDER_unload(fips);
+        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
+    }
+
+Note that this should be one of the first things that you do in your
+application. If any OpenSSL functions get called that require the use of
+cryptographic functions before this occurs then, if no provider has yet been
+loaded, then the default provider will be automatically loaded. If you then
+later explicitly load the FIPS provider then you will have both the FIPS and the
+default provider loaded at the same time. It is undefined which implementation
+of an algorithm will be used if multiple implementations are available and you
+have not explicitly specified via a property query (see below) which one should
+be used.
+
+Also note that in this example we have additionally loaded the &quot;base&quot; provider.
+This loads a sub-set of algorithms that are also available in the default
+provider - specifically non cryptographic ones which may be used in conjunction
+with the FIPS provider. For example this contains algorithms for encoding and
+decoding keys. If you decide not to load the default provider then you
+will usually want to load the base provider instead.
+
+In this example we are using the &quot;default&quot; library context. OpenSSL functions
+operate within the scope of a library context. If no library context is
+explicitly specified then the default library context is used. For further
+details about library contexts see the `OSSL_LIB_CTX(3)` man page.
+
+Loading the FIPS module at the same time as other providers
+-----------------------------------------------------------
+
+It is possible to have the FIPS provider and other providers (such as the
+default provider) all loaded at the same time into the same library context. You
+can use a property query string during algorithm fetches to specify which
+implementation you would like to use.
+
+For example to fetch an implementation of SHA256 which conforms to FIPS
+standards you can specify the property query `fips=yes` like this:
+
+    EVP_MD *sha256;
+
+    sha256 = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, &quot;SHA2-256&quot;, &quot;fips=yes&quot;);
+
+If no property query is specified, or more than one implementation matches the
+property query then it is undefined which implementation of a particular
+algorithm will be returned.
+
+This example shows an explicit request for an implementation of SHA256 from the
+default provider:
+
+    EVP_MD *sha256;
+
+    sha256 = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, &quot;SHA2-256&quot;, &quot;provider=default&quot;);
+
+It is also possible to set a default property query string. The following
+example sets the default property query of &quot;fips=yes&quot; for all fetches within the
+default library context:
+
+    EVP_set_default_properties(NULL, &quot;fips=yes&quot;);
+
+If a fetch function has both an explicit property query specified, and a
+default property query is defined then the two queries are merged together and
+both apply. The local property query overrides the default properties if the
+same property name is specified in both.
+
+There are two important built-in properties that you should be aware of:
+
+The &quot;provider&quot; property enables you to specify which provider you want an
+implementation to be fetched from, e.g. `provider=default` or `provider=fips`.
+All algorithms implemented in a provider have this property set on them.
+
+There is also the `fips` property. All FIPS algorithms match against the
+property query `fips=yes`. There are also some non-cryptographic algorithms
+available in the default and base providers that also have the `fips=yes`
+property defined for them. These are the encoder and decoder algorithms that
+can (for example) be used to write out a key generated in the FIPS provider to a
+file. The encoder and decoder algorithms are not in the FIPS module itself but
+are allowed to be used in conjunction with the FIPS algorithms.
+
+It is possible to specify default properties within a config file. For example
+the following config file automatically loads the default and fips providers and
+sets the default property value to be `fips=yes`. Note that this config file
+does not load the &quot;base&quot; provider. All supporting algorithms that are in &quot;base&quot;
+are also in &quot;default&quot;, so it is unnecessary in this case:
+
+    openssl_conf = openssl_init
+
+    .include /usr/local/ssl/fipsmodule.cnf
+
+    [openssl_init]
+    providers = provider_sect
+    alg_section = algorithm_sect
+
+    [provider_sect]
+    fips = fips_sect
+    default = default_sect
+
+    [default_sect]
+    activate = 1
+
+    [algorithm_sect]
+    default_properties = fips=yes
+
+Programmatically loading the FIPS module (non-default library context)
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+In addition to using properties to separate usage of the FIPS module from other
+usages this can also be achieved using library contexts. In this example we
+create two library contexts. In one we assume the existence of a config file
+called &quot;openssl-fips.cnf&quot; that automatically loads and configures the FIPS and
+base providers. The other library context will just use the default provider.
+
+    OSSL_LIB_CTX *fipslibctx, *nonfipslibctx;
+    OSSL_PROVIDER *defctxnull = NULL;
+    EVP_MD *fipssha256 = NULL, *nonfipssha256 = NULL;
+    int ret = 1;
+
+    /*
+     * Create two non-default library contexts. One for fips usage and one for
+     * non-fips usage
+     */
+    fipslibctx = OSSL_LIB_CTX_new();
+    nonfipslibctx = OSSL_LIB_CTX_new();
+    if (fipslibctx == NULL || nonfipslibctx == NULL)
+        goto err;
+
+    /* Prevent anything from using the default library context */
+    defctxnull = OSSL_PROVIDER_load(NULL, &quot;null&quot;);
+
+    /*
+     * Load config file for the FIPS library context. We assume that this
+     * config file will automatically activate the FIPS and base providers so we
+     * don't need to explicitly load them here.
+     */
+    if (!OSSL_LIB_CTX_load_config(fipslibctx, &quot;openssl-fips.cnf&quot;))
+        goto err;
+
+    /*
+     * We don't need to do anything special to load the default provider into
+     * nonfipslibctx. This happens automatically if no other providers are
+     * loaded. Because we don't call OSSL_LIB_CTX_load_config() explicitly for
+     * nonfipslibctx it will just use the default config file.
+     */
+
+    /* As an example get some digests */
+
+    /* Get a FIPS validated digest */
+    fipssha256 = EVP_MD_fetch(fipslibctx, &quot;SHA2-256&quot;, NULL);
+    if (fipssha256 == NULL)
+        goto err;
+
+    /* Get a non-FIPS validated digest */
+    nonfipssha256 = EVP_MD_fetch(nonfipslibctx, &quot;SHA2-256&quot;, NULL);
+    if (nonfipssha256 == NULL)
+        goto err;
+
+    /* Use the digests */
+
+    printf(&quot;Success\n&quot;);
+    ret = 0;
+
+    err:
+    EVP_MD_free(fipssha256);
+    EVP_MD_free(nonfipssha256);
+    OSSL_LIB_CTX_free(fipslibctx);
+    OSSL_LIB_CTX_free(nonfipslibctx);
+    OSSL_PROVIDER_unload(defctxnull);
+
+    return ret;
+
+Note that we have made use of the special &quot;null&quot; provider here which we load
+into the default library context. We could have chosen to use the default
+library context for FIPS usage, and just create one additional library context
+for other usages - or vice versa. However if code has not been converted to use
+library contexts then the default library context will be automatically used.
+This could be the case for your own existing applications as well as certain
+parts of OpenSSL itself. Not all parts of OpenSSL are library context aware. If
+this happens then you could &quot;accidentally&quot; use the wrong library context for a
+particular operation. To be sure this doesn't happen you can load the &quot;null&quot;
+provider into the default library context. Because a provider has been
+explicitly loaded, the default provider will not automatically load. This means
+code using the default context by accident will fail because no algorithms will
+be available.
+
+Using Encoders and Decoders with the FIPS module
+------------------------------------------------
+
+Encoders and decoders are used to read and write keys or parameters from or to
+some external format (for example a PEM file). If your application generates
+keys or parameters that then need to be written into PEM or DER format
+then it is likely that you will need to use an encoder to do this. Similarly
+you need a decoder to read previously saved keys and parameters. In most cases
+this will be invisible to you if you are using APIs that existed in
+OpenSSL 1.1.1 or earlier such as i2d_PrivateKey. However the appropriate
+encoder/decoder will need to be available in the library context associated with
+the key or parameter object. The built-in OpenSSL encoders and decoders are
+implemented in both the default and base providers and are not in the FIPS
+module boundary. However since they are not cryptographic algorithms themselves
+it is still possible to use them in conjunction with the FIPS module, and
+therefore these encoders/decoders have the &quot;fips=yes&quot; property against them.
+You should ensure that either the default or base provider is loaded into the
+library context in this case.
+
+Using the FIPS module in SSL/TLS
+--------------------------------
+
+Writing an application that uses libssl in conjunction with the FIPS module is
+much the same as writing a normal libssl application. If you are using global
+properties and the default library context to specify usage of FIPS validated
+algorithms then this will happen automatically for all cryptographic algorithms
+in libssl. If you are using a non-default library context to load the FIPS
+provider then you can supply this to libssl using the function
+`SSL_CTX_new_ex()`. This works as a drop in replacement for the function
+`SSL_CTX_new()` except it provides you with the capability to specify the
+library context to be used. You can also use the same function to specify
+libssl specific properties to use.
+
+In this first example we create two SSL_CTX objects using two different library
+contexts.
+
+    /*
+     * We assume that a non-default library context with the FIPS provider
+     * loaded has been created called fips_libctx.
+     /
+    SSL_CTX *fips_ssl_ctx = SSL_CTX_new_ex(fips_libctx, NULL, TLS_method());
+    /*
+     * We assume that a non-default library context with the default provider
+     * loaded has been created called non_fips_libctx.
+     */
+    SSL_CTX *non_fips_ssl_ctx = SSL_CTX_new_ex(non_fips_libctx, NULL,
+                                               TLS_method());
+
+In this second example we create two SSL_CTX objects using different properties
+to specify FIPS usage:
+
+    /*
+     * The &quot;fips=yes&quot; property includes all FIPS approved algorithms as well as
+     * encoders from the default provider that are allowed to be used. The NULL
+     * below indicates that we are using the default library context.
+     */
+    SSL_CTX *fips_ssl_ctx = SSL_CTX_new_ex(NULL, &quot;fips=yes&quot;, TLS_method());
+    /*
+     * The &quot;provider!=fips&quot; property allows algorithms from any provider except
+     * the FIPS provider
+     */
+    SSL_CTX *non_fips_ssl_ctx = SSL_CTX_new_ex(NULL, &quot;provider!=fips&quot;,
+                                               TLS_method());
+
+Confirming that an algorithm is being provided by the FIPS module
+-----------------------------------------------------------------
+
+A chain of links needs to be followed to go from an algorithm instance to the
+provider that implements it. The process is similar for all algorithms. Here the
+example of a digest is used.
+
+To go from an `EVP_MD_CTX` to an `EVP_MD`, use the `EVP_MD_CTX_md()` call. To go
+from the `EVP_MD` to its `OSSL_PROVIDER`, use the `EVP_MD_provider()` call. To
+extract the name from the `OSSL_PROVIDER`, use the `OSSL_PROVIDER_name()` call.
+Finally, use `strcmp(3)` or `printf(3)` on the name.
