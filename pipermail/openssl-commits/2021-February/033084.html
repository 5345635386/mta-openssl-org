 =head1 DESCRIPTION
 
 I&lt;This is not a complete description yet&gt;
 
 B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; is a complex type that's essentially a container for
-private/public key key pairs, but has had other uses as well.
+private/public key pairs, but has had other uses as well.
 
 =for comment &quot;uses&quot; could as well be &quot;abuses&quot;...
 
-It can contain the legacy form of keys -- i.e. pointers to the low-level key types, such as B&lt;RSA&gt;, B&lt;DSA&gt; and B&lt;EC&gt; --, but also the
-provided form of keys -- i.e. pointers to provider side key data.
-Those two forms are mutually exclusive; an B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; instance can't
-contain both a key in legacy form and in provided form.  Regardless of
-form, this key is commonly referred to as the &quot;origin&quot;.
-
-An B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; also contains a cache of provider side copies of the
-key, each adapted for the provider that is going to use that copy to
-perform some operation.
-For a legacy &quot;origin&quot;, the B&lt;EVP_PKEY_ASN1_METHOD&gt;'s functions
-export_to() and dirty_cnt() must be implemented for such caching to be
-possible.  For a provider side &quot;origin&quot;, the B&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT&gt;'s function
-OP_keymgmt_export() must be implemented.  In all cases, the receiving
-B&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT&gt; must have an implemented OP_keygmt_import().
+The private/public key pair that an B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; contains is refered to
+as its &quot;internal key&quot; or &quot;origin&quot; (the reason for &quot;origin&quot; is
+explained further down, in L&lt;/Export cache for provider operations&gt;),
+and it can take one of the following forms:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item legacy origin
+
+This is the form that an B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; in OpenSSL prior to 3.0 had.  The
+internal key in the B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; is a pointer to the low-level key
+types, such as B&lt;RSA&gt;, B&lt;DSA&gt; and B&lt;EC&gt;, or an engine driven
+structure, and is governed by an associated L&lt;EVP_PKEY_METHOD(3)&gt; and
+an L&lt;EVP_PKEY_ASN1_METHOD(3)&gt;.
+
+The functions available through those two method structures get full
+access to the B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; and therefore have a lot of freedom to
+modify whatever they want.  This also means that an B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; is a
+shared structure between libcrypto and any ENGINE that serves such
+methods.
+
+=item provider-native origin
+
+This is a new form in OpenSSL 3.0, which permits providers to hold the
+key data (see L&lt;provider-keymgmt(7)&gt;).  The internal key in the
+B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; is a pointer to that key data held by the provider, and
+is governed by an associated L&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT(3)&gt; method structure.
+
+The functions available through the L&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT(3)&gt; have no access
+to the B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt;, and can therefore not make any direct changes.
+Similarly, the key data that the B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; points at is only known
+to the functions pointed at in the L&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT(3)&gt;.
+
+=back
+
+These two forms can never co-exist in the same B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt;, the main
+reason being that having both at the same time will create problems
+with synchronising between the two forms, and potentially make it
+confusing which one of the two is the origin.
+
+=head2 Key mutability
+
+The B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; internal keys are mutable.
+
+This is especially visible with internal legacy keys, since they can
+be extracted with functions like L&lt;EVP_PKEY_get0_RSA(3)&gt; and then
+modified at will with functions like L&lt;RSA_set0_key(3)&gt;.
+
+Internal provider native keys are also possible to be modified, if the
+associated L&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT(3)&gt; implementation allows it.  This is done
+with L&lt;EVP_PKEY_set_params(3)&gt; and its specialised derivatives.  The
+OpenSSL providers allow it for the following:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item DH, EC, X25519, X448:
+
+It's possible to set the encoded public key.  This is supported in
+particular through L&lt;EVP_PKEY_set1_encoded_public_key(3)&gt;.
+
+=item EC:
+
+It's possible to flip the ECDH cofactor mode.
+
+=back
+
+Every time the B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; internal key mutates, an internal dirty
+count is incremented.  The need for a dirty count is explained further
+in L&lt;/Export cache for provider operations&gt;.
+
+For provider native origin keys, this doesn't require any help from
+the L&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT(3)&gt;, the dirty count is maintained in the B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt;
+itself, and is incremented every time L&lt;EVP_PKEY_set_params(3)&gt; or its
+specialised derivatives are called.
+For legacy origin keys, this requires the associated
+L&lt;EVP_PKEY_ASN1_METHOD(3)&gt; to implement the dirty_cnt() function.  All
+of OpenSSL's built-in L&lt;EVP_PKEY_ASN1_METHOD(3)&gt; implement this
+function.
+
+=head2 Export cache for provider operations
+
+OpenSSL 3.0 can handle operations such as signing, encrypting, etc in
+diverse providers, potentially others than the provider of the
+L&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT(3)&gt;.  Two providers, possibly from different vendors,
+can't be expected to share internal key structures.  There are
+therefore instances where key data will need to be exported to the
+provider that is going to perform the operation (this also implies
+that every provider that implements a key pair based operation must
+also implement an L&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT(3)&gt;).
+
+For performance reasons, libcrypto tries to minimize the need to
+perform such an export, so it maintains a cache of such exports in the
+B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt;.  Each cache entry has two items, a pointer to the
+provider side key data and the associated L&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT(3)&gt;.
+
+I&lt;This cache is often referred to as the &quot;operation key cache&quot;, and
+the key data that the cached keys came from is the &quot;origin&quot;, and since
+there are two forms of the latter, we have the &quot;legacy origin&quot; and the
+&quot;provider native origin&quot;.&gt;
+
+The export to the operation key cache can be performed independent of
+what form the origin has.
+For a legacy origin, this requires that the associated
+L&lt;EVP_PKEY_ASN1_METHOD(3)&gt; implements the functions export_to() and
+dirty_cnt().
+For a provider native origin, this requires that the associated
+L&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT(3)&gt; implements the OSSL_FUNC_keymgmt_export() function
+(see L&lt;provider-keymgmt(7)&gt;).
+In all cases, the receiving L&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT(3)&gt; (the one associated with
+the exported key data) must implement OSSL_FUNC_keymgmt_import().
 
 If such caching isn't supported, the operations that can be performed
-with that key are limited to the same backend as the &quot;origin&quot; key
-(ENGINE for legacy &quot;origin&quot; keys, provider for provider side &quot;origin&quot;
+with that key are limited to the same backend as the origin key
+(ENGINE for legacy origin keys, provider for provider side origin
 keys).
 
+=head3 Exporting implementation details
+
+
+Exporting a key to the operation cache involves the following:
+
+=over 4
+
+=item 1.
+
+Check if the dirty count for the internal origin key has changed since
+the previous time.  This is done by comparing it with a copy of the
+dirty count, which is maintained by the export function.
+
+If the dirty count has changed, the export cache is cleared.
+
+=item 2.
+
+Check if there's an entry in the export cache with the same
+L&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT(3)&gt; that's the same provider that an export is to be
+made to (which is the provider that's going to perform an operation
+for which the current B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; is going to be used).
+
+If such an entry is found, nothing more is done, the key data and
+L&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT(3)&gt; found in that export cache entry will be used for
+the operation to be performed.
+
+=item 3.
+
+Export the internal origin key to the provider, using the appropriate
+method.
+
+For legacy origin keys, that's done with the help of the
+L&lt;EVP_PKEY_ASN1_METHOD(3)&gt; export_to() function.
+
+For provider native origin keys, that's done by retrieving the key
+data in L&lt;OSSL_PARAM(3)&gt; form from the origin keys, using the
+OSSL_FUNC_keymgmt_export() functions of the associated
+L&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT(3)&gt;, and sending that data to the L&lt;EVP_KEYMGMT(3)&gt; of
+the provider that's to perform the operation, using its
+OSSL_FUNC_keymgmt_import() function.
+
+=back
+
+=head2 Upgrading and downgrading a key
+
+An B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; with a legacy origin will I&lt;never&gt; be upgraded to
+become an B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; with a provider native origin.  Instead, we have
+the operation cache as described above, that takes care of the needs
+of the diverse operation the application may want to perform.
+
+An B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; with a provider native origin, I&lt;may&gt; be downgraded to
+be I&lt;transformed&gt; into an B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; with a legacy origin.  Because
+an B&lt;EVP_PKEY&gt; can't have two origins, it means that it stops having a
+provider native origin.  The previous provider native key data is
+moved to the operation cache.  Downgrading is performed with the
+internal function L&lt;evp_pkey_downgrade(3)&gt;.
+
+I&lt;Downgrading a key is understandably fragile&gt;, and possibly surprising,
+and should therefore be done I&lt;as little as possible&gt;, but is needed
+to be able to support functions like L&lt;EVP_PKEY_get0_RSA(3)&gt;.
+The general recommendation is to use L&lt;evp_pkey_copy_downgraded(3)&gt;
+whenever possible, which it should be if the need for a legacy origin
+is only internal, or better yet, to remove the need for downgrade at
+all.
