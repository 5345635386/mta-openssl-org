+          &lt;p&gt;This document defines the bylaws under which the OpenSSL Project
+          operates. It defines the different project roles, how they contribute
+          to the project, and how project decisions are made.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;h2&gt;Roles and Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;
+
+          &lt;h3&gt;Users&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;Users include any individual or organisation that downloads,
+          installs, compiles, or uses the OpenSSL command line applications or
+          the OpenSSL libraries or the OpenSSL documentation. This includes
+          OpenSSL-based derivatives such as patched versions of OpenSSL provided
+          through OS distributions, often known as &quot;downstream&quot; versions.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;Users may request help and assistance from the project through any
+          appropriate forum as designated by the OpenSSL Management Committee
+          (OMC). Users may also report bugs, issues, or feature requests; or
+          make pull requests through any OMC designated channel.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;h3&gt;Committers&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;Committers have the ability to make new commits to the main OpenSSL
+          Project repository. Collectively, they have the responsibility for
+          maintaining the contents of that repository. They must ensure that any
+          committed contributions are consistent with all appropriate OpenSSL
+          policies and procedures as defined by the OMC.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;Committers also have a responsibility to review code submissions in
+          accordance with OpenSSL project policies and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;Commit access is granted as a result of a vote by the OMC. It may
+          be withdrawn at any time by a vote of the OMC.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;A condition of commit access is that the committer has signed an
+          Individual Contributor Licence Agreement (ICLA). If contributions may
+          also be from the employer of an individual with commit access then a
+          Corporate Contributor Licence Agreement (CCLA) must also be signed and
+          include the name of the committer.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;In order to retain commit access a committer must have authored or
+          reviewed at least one commit within the previous two calendar
+          quarters. This will be checked at the beginning of each calendar
+          quarter. This rule does not apply if the committer first received
+          their commit access during the previous calendar quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;h3&gt;OpenSSL Management Committee (OMC)&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;The OMC represents the official voice of the project. All official
+          OMC decisions are taken on the basis of a vote.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;The OMC:&lt;/p&gt;
+          &lt;ul&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;makes all decisions regarding management and strategic direction
+            of the project;&lt;/li&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;sets and maintains all policies and procedures;&lt;/li&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;nominates, elects and removes committers and OMC members as
+            required;&lt;/li&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;ensures security issues are dealt with in an appropriate
+            manner;&lt;/li&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;schedules releases and determines future release plans and the
+            development roadmap and priorities;&lt;/li&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;maintains all other repositories according to the policies and
+            procedures they define.&lt;/li&gt;
+          &lt;/ul&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;Membership of the OMC is by invitation only from the existing OMC
+          following a passing vote. OMC members may or may not be committers as
+          well. If an OMC member is also a committer then all rules that apply
+          to committers still apply.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;The OMC makes decisions on behalf of the project. In order to have
+          a valid voice on the OMC, members must be actively contributing to the
+          project. Note that there are many ways to contribute to the project
+          but the ones that count in order to participate in the OMC
+          decision-making process are the ones listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;OMC members may become inactive. In order to remain active a member
+          must, in any calendar quarter, contribute by:&lt;/p&gt;
+          &lt;ul&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;a) Having authored, or been recorded as a reviewer of, at least
+            one commit made to any OpenSSL repository (including non-code based
+            ones) and&lt;/li&gt;
+            &lt;li&gt;b) vote in at least two-thirds of the total votes closed in the
+            first two months of the quarter and the last month of the preceding
+            quarter.&lt;/li&gt;
+          &lt;/ul&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;The above rules will be applied at the beginning of each calender
+          quarter. It does not apply if the OMC member was first appointed, or
+          became active again during the previous calendar quarter. The voting
+          requirement only includes those votes after the time the member joined
+          or was made active again.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;If an OMC member remains inactive for one calendar quarter then
+          they will no longer be considered an OMC member, but will be listed as
+          an OMC Alumni. OMC Alumni have no access to OMC internal resources
+          (including email lists) but may request a vote at any time to
+          reinstate their membership in the OMC.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;Any OMC member can propose a vote to declare another member
+          inactive or remove them from OMC membership entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;An OMC member can declare themselves inactive, leave the OMC, or
+          leave the project entirely. This does not require a vote.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;An inactive OMC member can propose a vote that the OMC declare them
+          active again. Inactive OMC members cannot vote but can propose issues
+          to vote on and participate in discussions. They retain access to OMC
+          internal resources.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;h3&gt;OpenSSL Software Foundation (OSF)&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;The OpenSSL Software Foundation represents the OpenSSL project in
+          legal and most official formal capacities in relation to external
+          entities and individuals. This includes, but is not limited to,
+          managing contributor license agreements, managing donations,
+          registering and holding trademarks, registering and holding domain
+          names, obtaining external legal advice, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;Any OMC member may serve as a director of OSF if they wish. To do
+          so they should send a request to any existing OSF director.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;h3&gt;OpenSSL Software Services (OSS)&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL Software Services represents the OpenSSL project for most
+          commercial and quasi-commercial  contexts, such as providing formal
+          support contracts and brokering consulting contracts for OpenSSL
+          committers.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;Any OMC member may serve as a director of OSS if they wish, subject
+          to certain contractual requirements. To do so they should send a
+          request to any existing OSS director.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;h3&gt;OpenSSL Validation Services (OVS)&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL Validation Services handles commercial activities specific
+          to FIPS 140 validations and the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module. Membership
+          of this organisation is by invitation from an existing director.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;h2&gt;OMC Voting Procedures&lt;/h2&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;A vote to change these bylaws will pass if it obtains an in favour
+          vote by more than two thirds of the active OMC members and less than
+          one quarter votes against by the active OMC members. A vote that does
+          not change these bylaws will pass if it has had a vote registered from
+          a majority of active OMC members and has had more votes registered in
+          favour than votes registered against.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;Only active OMC members may vote. A registered vote is a vote in
+          favour, a vote against, or an abstention.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;Any OMC member (active or inactive) can propose a vote. OMC Alumni
+          may only propose a vote to reinstate themselves to the OMC. Each vote
+          must include a closing date which must be between seven and fourteen
+          calendar days after the start of the vote. Votes to change these
+          bylaws must be fourteen calendar days in duration.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;In exceptional cases, the closing date for non-bylaw changing votes
+          could be less than seven calendar days; for example, a critical issue
+          that needs rapid action. A critical issue is hard to define precisely
+          but would include cases where a security fix is needed and the details
+          will soon be made public. At least one other active OMC member besides
+          the proposer needs to agree to the shorter timescale.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;A vote closes on its specified date. In addition, any active OMC
+          member can declare a vote closed once the number of uncast votes could
+          not affect the outcome. Any active OMC member may change their vote up
+          until the vote is closed. No vote already cast can be changed after
+          the vote is closed. Votes may continue to be cast and recorded after a
+          vote is closed up until fourteen days after the start of the vote.
+          These votes will count for the purposes of determining OMC member
+          activity, but will otherwise not affect the outcome of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+          &lt;p&gt;All votes and their outcomes should be recorded and available to
+          all OMC members.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+        &lt;/div&gt;
+        &lt;footer&gt;
