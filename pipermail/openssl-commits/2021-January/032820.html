+=head1 NAME
+
+openssl-threads - Overview of thread safety in OpenSSL
+
+=head1 DESCRIPTION
+
+In this man page, we use the term B&lt;thread-safe&gt; to indicate that an
+object or function can be used by multiple threads at the same time.
+
+OpenSSL can be built with or without threads support. The most important
+use of this support is so that OpenSSL itself can use a single consistent
+API, as shown in L&lt;CRYPTO_THREAD_run_once(3)/EXAMPLES&gt;.
+Multi-platform applications can also use this API.
+
+In particular, being configured for threads support does not imply that
+all OpenSSL objects are thread-safe.
+To emphasize: I&lt;most objects are not safe for simultaneous use&gt;.
+Exceptions to this should be documented on the specific manual pages, and
+some general high-level guidance is given here.
+
+One major use of the OpenSSL thread API is to implement reference counting.
+Many objects within OpenSSL are reference-counted, so resources are not
+released, until the last reference is removed.
+References are often increased automatically (such as when an B&lt;X509&gt;
+certificate object is added into an B&lt;X509_STORE&gt; trust store).
+There is often an B&lt;I&lt;object&gt;_up_ref&gt;() function that can be used to increase
+the reference count.
+Failure to match B&lt;I&lt;object&gt;_up_ref&gt;() calls with the right number of
+B&lt;I&lt;object&gt;_free&gt;() calls is a common source of memory leaks when a program
+exits.
+
+Many objects have set and get API's to set attributes in the object.
+A C&lt;set0&gt; passes ownership from the caller to the object and a
+C&lt;get0&gt; returns a pointer but the attribute ownership
+remains with the object and a reference to it is returned.
+A C&lt;set1&gt; or C&lt;get1&gt; function does not change the ownership, but instead
+updates the attribute's reference count so that the object is shared
+between the caller and the object; the caller must free the returned
+attribute when finished.
+Functions that involve attributes that have reference counts themselves,
+but are named with just C&lt;set&gt; or C&lt;get&gt; are historical; and the documentation
+must state how the references are handled.
+Get methods are often thread-safe as long as the ownership requirements are
+met and shared objects are not modified.
+Set methods, or modifying shared objects, are generally not thread-safe
+as discussed below.
+
+Objects are thread-safe
+as long as the API's being invoked don't modify the object; in this
+case the parameter is usually marked in the API as C&lt;const&gt;.
+Not all parameters are marked this way.
+Note that a C&lt;const&gt; declaration does not mean immutable; for example
+L&lt;X509_cmp(3)&gt; takes pointers to C&lt;const&gt; objects, but the implementation
+uses a C cast to remove that so it can lock objects, generate and cache
+a DER encoding, and so on.
+
+Another instance of thread-safety is when updates to an object's
+internal state, such as cached values, are done with locks.
+One example of this is the reference counting API's described above.
+
+In all cases, however, it is generally not safe for one thread to
+mutate an object, such as setting elements of a private or public key,
+while another thread is using that object, such as verifying a signature.
+
+The same API's can usually be used simultaneously on different objects
+without interference.
+For example, two threads can calculate a signature using two different
+B&lt;EVP_PKEY_CTX&gt; objects.
+
+For implicit global state or singletons, thread-safety depends on the facility.
+The L&lt;CRYPTO_secure_malloc(3)&gt; and related API's have their own lock,
+while L&lt;CRYPTO_malloc(3)&gt; assumes the underlying platform allocation
+will do any necessary locking.
+Some API's, such as L&lt;NCONF_load(3)&gt; and related, or L&lt;OBJ_create(3)&gt;
+do no locking at all; this can be considered a bug.
+
+A separate, although related, issue is modifying &quot;factory&quot; objects
+when other objects have been created from that.
+For example, an B&lt;SSL_CTX&gt; object created by L&lt;SSL_CTX_new(3)&gt; is used
+to create per-connection B&lt;SSL&gt; objects by calling L&lt;SSL_new(3)&gt;.
+In this specific case, and probably for factory methods in general, it is
+not safe to modify the factory object after it has been used to create
+other objects.
