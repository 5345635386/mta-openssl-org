Well, I'd say, apparently the consensus is at least not to restrict
what is currently recognized as &quot;fully&quot; overlapping.

All depends obviously on how &quot;partially&quot; overlapping is defined:
a) by humans
b) by OpenSSL

a)
I think humans would normally say two objects are partially overlapping
when they overlap, but do not fully overlap, in other words partially
overlapping in and out do have some common bytes, but do not start at
the same address, thus in != out.

b)
What is currently recognized as partially overlapping in the evp_enc.c
is a) but adds some I would say ad-hoc exceptions to accommodate one
special use case with certain block ciphers.  Yet it does for instance
artificially restrict use cases where other ciphers work just fine.

I think for instance of WRAP mode, where the primitive basically
supports arbitrary overlapping (uses memmove) but we can no longer
use that feature because of the partially overlapping check in the
EVP cipher handling.

And the other use case, which I think is worth to mention is

unsigned char *inp = buf + sizeof(buf) - 1, *out = buf;
for (i = 0; i&lt;sizeof(buf)-X; i++) {
     *inp = getc();
     EVP_EncryptUpdate(ctx, out, &amp;outl, inp, 1);
     out += outl;
}

This could work for some cipher modes at least.

And I think our overall assumption here is the user knows perfectly
well how the internal state of the ctx is at any time, otherwise
EVP_EncryptUpdate would probably need to have an input parameter to
tell how large the output buffer is in reality :)

So I think maybe we can just change the definition for b) to be

Partially overlapping is any kind of overlapping that is known to be
not working in the evp cipher update function.
It is dependent on the cipher mode, and dependent on the internal state
of the cipher context.

It is often the case that partially overlapping means overlapping
with in != out but most importantly the code in evp_enc.c is known
to fail if it was allowed to continue after EVP_R_PARTIALLY_OVERLAPPING.
