<PRE>Hi,

Andy pointed out that my last e-mail was probably not clear enough.

I want to drop the current partially overlapping checks
on the WRAP mode ciphers (which were ineffective anyways).

And allow the following additional use case for any cipher

unsigned char *in = buf + sizeof(buf) - X, *out = buf;
EVP_EncryptUpdate(ctx, out, &amp;outl, &amp;head, sizeof(head));
out += outl;
EVP_EncryptUpdate(ctx, out, &amp;outl, in, X);
out += outl;
EVP_EncryptUpdate(ctx, out, &amp;outl, &amp;tail, sizeof(tail));
out += outl;

with X &gt; 75% sizeof(buf)
sizeof(head), sizeof(tail) not necessary multiple of block size

And make the definition of allowed in-place partially overlapping
effectively be driven by the implementation requirements.


Bernd.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This should work.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It does only work, if you know that ctx-&gt;buf_len == 0
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> before the loop is entered.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's naturally implied that ctx is used *consistently*. I mean it's not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like it's suggested that you can just use the above snippet in random
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> place. Application would have to adhere to above pattern all along, for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the life time of in-place processing &quot;session&quot;. [I write &quot;session&quot; in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quotes, because there might be better term.]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It does not work with CFB1, CCM, XTS and WRAP modes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, some modes are so to say &quot;one-shot&quot;, i.e. you have to pass all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data there is at once, no increments are allowed. But what does it have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to do with question at hand, question about in-place processing that is?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These two things are independent. So that question is rather should the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> snippet work in cases when incremental processing is an option. Related
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thing to recognize in the context is that *disputable* condition, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one that triggered this discussion, is exercised only when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ctx-&gt;block_size is larger than 1, because then ctx-&gt;buf_len remains 0.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Note that ctx-&gt;block_size for CFB1, CCM and XTS is 1. As for WRAP, yeah,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's special...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There is no access function to get the internal state of the cipher
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> context.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But there is notion of in-place processing &quot;session&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I'd say, apparently the consensus is at least not to restrict
</I>&gt;<i> what is currently recognized as &quot;fully&quot; overlapping.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All depends obviously on how &quot;partially&quot; overlapping is defined:
</I>&gt;<i> a) by humans
</I>&gt;<i> b) by OpenSSL
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a)
</I>&gt;<i> I think humans would normally say two objects are partially overlapping
</I>&gt;<i> when they overlap, but do not fully overlap, in other words partially
</I>&gt;<i> overlapping in and out do have some common bytes, but do not start at
</I>&gt;<i> the same address, thus in != out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> b)
</I>&gt;<i> What is currently recognized as partially overlapping in the evp_enc.c
</I>&gt;<i> is a) but adds some I would say ad-hoc exceptions to accommodate one
</I>&gt;<i> special use case with certain block ciphers.&#160; Yet it does for instance
</I>&gt;<i> artificially restrict use cases where other ciphers work just fine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think for instance of WRAP mode, where the primitive basically
</I>&gt;<i> supports arbitrary overlapping (uses memmove) but we can no longer
</I>&gt;<i> use that feature because of the partially overlapping check in the
</I>&gt;<i> EVP cipher handling.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And the other use case, which I think is worth to mention is
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> unsigned char *inp = buf + sizeof(buf) - 1, *out = buf;
</I>&gt;<i> for (i = 0; i&lt;sizeof(buf)-X; i++) {
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;&#160;&#160; *inp = getc();
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;&#160;&#160; EVP_EncryptUpdate(ctx, out, &amp;outl, inp, 1);
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;&#160;&#160; out += outl;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This could work for some cipher modes at least.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And I think our overall assumption here is the user knows perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> well how the internal state of the ctx is at any time, otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> EVP_EncryptUpdate would probably need to have an input parameter to
</I>&gt;<i> tell how large the output buffer is in reality :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I think maybe we can just change the definition for b) to be
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Partially overlapping is any kind of overlapping that is known to be
</I>&gt;<i> not working in the evp cipher update function.
</I>&gt;<i> It is dependent on the cipher mode, and dependent on the internal state
</I>&gt;<i> of the cipher context.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is often the case that partially overlapping means overlapping
</I>&gt;<i> with in != out but most importantly the code in evp_enc.c is known
</I>&gt;<i> to fail if it was allowed to continue after EVP_R_PARTIALLY_OVERLAPPING.
