<PRE>Hi OpenSSL,

I would like to drop this email as a note for you guys (and other people who cares about this project) to know:

Yesterday I was invited to an &#8216;open source and cloud computing&#8217; conference in Beijing to give a speech on OpenSSL. The topic of the presentation was &#8216;Post-Heartbleed Era of OpenSSL&#8217;, which focused on important events happened in the project from 2014 to 2018. I started the speech with a very quick look-back on Heartbleed and then moved to talk about what happened in the project chronologically, including important release (1.0.2, 1.1.0, 1.1.1), important improvements in those releases (code reformat, old code delete, removal of weak ciphers and protocols...), important features (TLSv1.3, new DRBG, SHA-3, ASYNC, STORE&#8230;), important policies and community development (license changing, moving to utilize Github, attitudes to crypto algos, last China tour&#8230;), and at last I introduced the openssl-book project.

The result was great.

Tech guys in the audience were excited about the nowadays OpenSSL and they believed the project is becoming better. And even a Chinese local book publisher asked me if it&#8217;s possible to publish the Chinese edition of the openssl-book as paper copy in China, and after discussing with some OMC members, we found it&#8217;s possible to do so. Of course, that would happen after the book is really finished someday in the future. And I hope some amount of the profit made by selling the book could be returned back to OpenSSL foundation, as a way of helping the project.

As far as I know this was the first time that the big picture of OpenSSL was reviewed and discussed in a major, high level China tech conference, in Chinese language.

I think there will be videos available online and also articles reporting this presentation in a few days, but since they are all in Chinese, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s helpful to share them to this list when they are ready.

Regards,

Paul Yang
