</I>
I don't follow. What does &quot;underlying cipher's implementation needs&quot;
mean? Or aren't you making quite specific assumption about
implementation the moment you recognize its &quot;needs&quot;? Assumption that it
does in fact processes data in specific order? Does it need to do that?
As *hypothetic* extreme example, consider ECB mode. What prevents
implementation to process blocks in arbitrary order? And if nothing,
what effect would reverse order have for suggested approach? Once again,
I'm not saying that any of our ECB implementation do that, only that
it's *formally* inappropriate to make that kind of assumption. To
summarize, if one wants to permit partially overlapping buffers, then
the only appropriate thing to do would be to perform operations in
chunks on non-overlapping sections. However, I'm not saying that we
should do that, I'd say that it would be unjustified complication of the
code. <A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/5427#discussion_r172441266">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/5427#discussion_r172441266</A>
is sufficient.
