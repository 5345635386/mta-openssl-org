Once again:
- This PR *recognizes* the fact that special cases do in fact *exist*.
- The EVP layer has to be more aware of special cases anyhow.
- The test coverage of error cases is not perfect, but I try to
   improve that.
- I don't see why we can't relax a check in cases that are known to
   work, especially when test cases are added at the same time.
