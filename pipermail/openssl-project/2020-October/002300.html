<PRE>There's no reason for the EVP layer to check for the presence or the
absence or the public key, for one very simple reason: it doesn't have
access to the backend key structure and therefore has no possibility
to make any such checks.  Such checks should be made in the backend.

That part of your proposed vote text that mentions checks in EVP
doesn't make any sense with that in mind, and I fear that it would
lead us into a rabbit hole that's not really necessary.  Also, this
contradicts the intentions of the design for libcrypto vs providers,
which was that libcrypto (and therefore EVP) would be a rather thin
layer that simply passes stuff to the providers and gets results back
(there are things that complicate this a bit, but this is essentially
what we do), and leave it to the provider to decide what to do and how
to do it.

Cheers,
Richard

</I>&gt;<i> The way I see it, the intention if the vote passes is to do more than stated:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. change the long-documented assumption
</I>&gt;<i> 2. fix &quot;regressions&quot; in 3.0 limited to things that worked in a certain
</I>&gt;<i> way in 1.1.1 (and maybe before), _despite_ the documented assumption
</I>&gt;<i> 3. test all existing functions that access the public key component of
</I>&gt;<i> `EVP_PKEY` (or lower level) objects to ensure they don't rely on the
</I>&gt;<i> long-documented assumption
</I>&gt;<i> 4. fix all the places that intentionally relied on the long-documented
</I>&gt;<i> assumption and that were required to avoid &quot;useless NULL checks&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that to change a widely and longed-enforced assumption like
</I>&gt;<i> this, we can't rely on a single case or a list of single cases that
</I>&gt;<i> worked _despite_ the documented assumption as proof that things can
</I>&gt;<i> (and should) work a certain way or another, and that before taking the
</I>&gt;<i> decision this late in the development process the results of thorough
</I>&gt;<i> testing are a prerequisite to assess the extent of code changes
</I>&gt;<i> required by changing the assumption and the potential for instability
</I>&gt;<i> and disruption that this can cause for our direct and indirect users
</I>&gt;<i> if segfaults slip through our currently limited coverage as a
</I>&gt;<i> consequence of this change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I feel that we are currently underestimating the potential impact of
</I>&gt;<i> this change, and currently motivated by a handful of isolated cases in
</I>&gt;<i> which under a very specific set of conditions things aligned in a way
</I>&gt;<i> that allowed certain usage patterns to succeed despite the documented
</I>&gt;<i> assumption.
</I>&gt;<i> I also feel that the &quot;burden of the proof&quot; of improving the test
</I>&gt;<i> coverage to exhaustively cover all kinds of keys (both in their legacy
</I>&gt;<i> form and in provider-native form), under all possible operations at
</I>&gt;<i> different abstraction levels (e.g. limiting this example to
</I>&gt;<i> sign/verify as the operation, testing should not be limited to
</I>&gt;<i> `EVP_DigestSign/Verify()`, but also through
</I>&gt;<i> `EVP_DigestSign/Verify{Init,Update,Final}()`,
</I>&gt;<i> `EVP_PKEY_sign/verify*()`, `(EC)DSA_(do_)sign/verify()`, etc.,
</I>&gt;<i> external testing with ENGINEs that might rely on the long-documented
</I>&gt;<i> assumption), should fall on who is proposing this change, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> committing that we will be able to increase our coverage to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> unforeseen consequences of changing the assumption, before we can
</I>&gt;<i> decide to commit to alter the assumption.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, to better capture the extent of work required to apply the change
</I>&gt;<i> and the risks associated with it I would rephrase the text vote as
</I>&gt;<i> follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We should change the 3.0 code to explicitly allow private components
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to exist in keys without the public components also being present,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ensuring that, in `EVP` and in the lower abstraction layers, both in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; legacy and in provider-native codepaths, _every_ instance in which any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; public key component is dereferenced it is preceded by a NULL pointer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; check or guaranteed non-NULL from any caller.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To change the long documented assumption, we commit to improve test
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; coverage of all public functions directly or indirectly triggering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; potential access to public key components, to prevent the risk of user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; facing crashes.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Issue #12612 exposes a problem with how we handle keys that contain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; private components but not public components.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is a widespread assumption in the code that keys with private
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; components must have public components. There is text in our public
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; documentation that states this (and that text dates back to 2006).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OTOH, the code has not always enforced this. Issue #12612 describes a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scenario where this has not historically been enforced, and it now is in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the current 3.0 code causing a regression.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are differences of opinion on how this should be handled. Some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have the opinion that we should change the model so that we explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allow private keys to exists without the public components. Others feel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that we should continue with the old model.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems we need a vote to decide this. Here is my proposed vote text:
