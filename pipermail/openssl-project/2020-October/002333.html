Yes, we are talking here about the 3.0 design document. And no, there
is no &quot;remove from the code&quot; deprecation kind of. There is no such
thing on this list that we are voting upon either, except for two
things - C code output and passwd -crypt - and both of them are
explicitly mentioned to require OMC vote to drop completely. So this is
misunderstanding. The problem is that the current state of the API does
not deprecate (as in add deprecation warnings and disable in no-
deprecated build) many low level API things that are supposed to be
deprecated. And we list them here in this list as a requirement to be
finished before the 3.0 can be declared feature complete.
