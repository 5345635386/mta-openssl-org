It seems to me that we have various ways forward:
1) Enforce that a private key requires the public key
2) Don't enforce it, just give an error when you try to use the
   public key and it's not available.
3) Make it work for the same cases that worked with 1.1.1
4) Generate the public key from the private key
5) Have some kind of transition where we do 2), 3)
   or 4) in 3.0, but will move to 1) at some later point.
6) do 2), but enforce it in the fips provider

I don't know if we do any any kind of consistency checks on the key
now when it's loaded. But 2) would then imply that the check is
skipped instead of returning an error.
