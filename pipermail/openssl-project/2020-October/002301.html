<PRE>Re; &quot;enforcement&quot;

My impression is that there is no such enforcement, because the
project has (had?) a stance on &quot;avoid NULL checks&quot; and &quot;consider
things that break our documented assumptions as programmer errors&quot;.

The natural result of these two principles may very well be the
deliberate reason why &quot;enforcement&quot; cannot be found and we might
perceive documentation written in 2006 as not current.

I can say that in the past 4 years within PR I authored or
co-authored, even before becoming a Committer, I can recall reviews
requesting to amend the code to avoid NULL checks on the public key
component because it is our convention that an EVP_PKEY with key
material is either a public key or a key pair.

</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell, the existing &quot;enforcement&quot; is in the algorithm

</I>&gt;<i> 1.1.1:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> crypto/rsa/rsa_ossl.c
</I>&gt;<i> crypto/dsa/dsa_ossl.c
</I>&gt;<i> crypto/dh/dh_key.c
</I>&gt;<i> crypto/ec/ecdsa_ossl.c
</I>&gt;<i> crypto/ec/ecdh_ossl.c
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I first had a look at the key computing functions in dh_key.c and
</I>&gt;<i> ecdh_ossl.c, because I was told that the public key is looked at
</I>&gt;<i> there.  This turns out to be somewhat false; they do look at a public
</I>&gt;<i> key, the public key of the peer key that they get passed, which isn't
</I>&gt;<i> quite the same.  However, when it comes to the DH or EC_KEY they work
</I>&gt;<i> with, only the private half is looked at,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looking at dsa_ossl.c and ecdsa_ossl.c, I can see that the signing
</I>&gt;<i> functions do NOT look a |pub_key|, and the verification functions do
</I>&gt;<i> NOT look at |priv_key|.  This seems perfectly normal to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly, the signing functions in rsa_ossl.c do NOT seem to look at
</I>&gt;<i> |d|, and the verification functions do NOT seem to look at |e|.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I took a moment to search through the corresponding *meth.c files to
</I>&gt;<i> see if I could quickly grep for some kind of check, and found none.
</I>&gt;<i> Mind you, that was a *quick* grep, someone more thorough might want to
</I>&gt;<i> confirm or contradict.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, having looked through that code, my sense is that the &quot;enforcement&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> that's talked about is non-existent, or at least very unclear, and I
</I>&gt;<i> suspect that if there is some sort of &quot;enforcement&quot; at that level,
</I>&gt;<i> it's more accidental than by design...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what to make of the documentation from 2006.  Considering
</I>&gt;<i> the level of involvement there was from diverse people (2006 wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the most eventful time), there's a possibility that it was a
</I>&gt;<i> precaution (&quot;don't touch that can of worms!&quot;) than a firm decision.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe the current formulation is slightly concealing part of the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The way I see it, the intention if the vote passes is to do more than stated:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. change the long-documented assumption
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. fix &quot;regressions&quot; in 3.0 limited to things that worked in a certain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way in 1.1.1 (and maybe before), _despite_ the documented assumption
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. test all existing functions that access the public key component of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; `EVP_PKEY` (or lower level) objects to ensure they don't rely on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; long-documented assumption
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. fix all the places that intentionally relied on the long-documented
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assumption and that were required to avoid &quot;useless NULL checks&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe that to change a widely and longed-enforced assumption like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this, we can't rely on a single case or a list of single cases that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worked _despite_ the documented assumption as proof that things can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (and should) work a certain way or another, and that before taking the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision this late in the development process the results of thorough
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; testing are a prerequisite to assess the extent of code changes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; required by changing the assumption and the potential for instability
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and disruption that this can cause for our direct and indirect users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if segfaults slip through our currently limited coverage as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consequence of this change.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I feel that we are currently underestimating the potential impact of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this change, and currently motivated by a handful of isolated cases in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which under a very specific set of conditions things aligned in a way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that allowed certain usage patterns to succeed despite the documented
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assumption.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also feel that the &quot;burden of the proof&quot; of improving the test
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; coverage to exhaustively cover all kinds of keys (both in their legacy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; form and in provider-native form), under all possible operations at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different abstraction levels (e.g. limiting this example to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sign/verify as the operation, testing should not be limited to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; `EVP_DigestSign/Verify()`, but also through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; `EVP_DigestSign/Verify{Init,Update,Final}()`,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; `EVP_PKEY_sign/verify*()`, `(EC)DSA_(do_)sign/verify()`, etc.,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; external testing with ENGINEs that might rely on the long-documented
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assumption), should fall on who is proposing this change, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; committing that we will be able to increase our coverage to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unforeseen consequences of changing the assumption, before we can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decide to commit to alter the assumption.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, to better capture the extent of work required to apply the change
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the risks associated with it I would rephrase the text vote as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; follows:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; We should change the 3.0 code to explicitly allow private components
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to exist in keys without the public components also being present,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ensuring that, in `EVP` and in the lower abstraction layers, both in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; legacy and in provider-native codepaths, _every_ instance in which any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; public key component is dereferenced it is preceded by a NULL pointer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; check or guaranteed non-NULL from any caller.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; To change the long documented assumption, we commit to improve test
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; coverage of all public functions directly or indirectly triggering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; potential access to public key components, to prevent the risk of user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; facing crashes.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Issue #12612 exposes a problem with how we handle keys that contain

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; There is a widespread assumption in the code that keys with private

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; OTOH, the code has not always enforced this. Issue #12612 describes a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; scenario where this has not historically been enforced, and it now is in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the current 3.0 code causing a regression.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; There are differences of opinion on how this should be handled. Some

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that we should continue with the old model.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
