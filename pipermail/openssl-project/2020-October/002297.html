<PRE>I would also be ok with this vote text formulation. Lets see what others
say.

</I>&gt;<i> The way I see it, the intention if the vote passes is to do more than stated:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. change the long-documented assumption
</I>&gt;<i> 2. fix &quot;regressions&quot; in 3.0 limited to things that worked in a certain
</I>&gt;<i> way in 1.1.1 (and maybe before), _despite_ the documented assumption
</I>&gt;<i> 3. test all existing functions that access the public key component of
</I>&gt;<i> `EVP_PKEY` (or lower level) objects to ensure they don't rely on the
</I>&gt;<i> long-documented assumption
</I>&gt;<i> 4. fix all the places that intentionally relied on the long-documented
</I>&gt;<i> assumption and that were required to avoid &quot;useless NULL checks&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that to change a widely and longed-enforced assumption like
</I>&gt;<i> this, we can't rely on a single case or a list of single cases that
</I>&gt;<i> worked _despite_ the documented assumption as proof that things can
</I>&gt;<i> (and should) work a certain way or another, and that before taking the
</I>&gt;<i> decision this late in the development process the results of thorough
</I>&gt;<i> testing are a prerequisite to assess the extent of code changes
</I>&gt;<i> required by changing the assumption and the potential for instability
</I>&gt;<i> and disruption that this can cause for our direct and indirect users
</I>&gt;<i> if segfaults slip through our currently limited coverage as a
</I>&gt;<i> consequence of this change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I feel that we are currently underestimating the potential impact of
</I>&gt;<i> this change, and currently motivated by a handful of isolated cases in
</I>&gt;<i> which under a very specific set of conditions things aligned in a way
</I>&gt;<i> that allowed certain usage patterns to succeed despite the documented
</I>&gt;<i> assumption.
</I>&gt;<i> I also feel that the &quot;burden of the proof&quot; of improving the test
</I>&gt;<i> coverage to exhaustively cover all kinds of keys (both in their legacy
</I>&gt;<i> form and in provider-native form), under all possible operations at
</I>&gt;<i> different abstraction levels (e.g. limiting this example to
</I>&gt;<i> sign/verify as the operation, testing should not be limited to
</I>&gt;<i> `EVP_DigestSign/Verify()`, but also through
</I>&gt;<i> `EVP_DigestSign/Verify{Init,Update,Final}()`,
</I>&gt;<i> `EVP_PKEY_sign/verify*()`, `(EC)DSA_(do_)sign/verify()`, etc.,
</I>&gt;<i> external testing with ENGINEs that might rely on the long-documented
</I>&gt;<i> assumption), should fall on who is proposing this change, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> committing that we will be able to increase our coverage to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> unforeseen consequences of changing the assumption, before we can
</I>&gt;<i> decide to commit to alter the assumption.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, to better capture the extent of work required to apply the change
</I>&gt;<i> and the risks associated with it I would rephrase the text vote as
</I>&gt;<i> follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We should change the 3.0 code to explicitly allow private components
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to exist in keys without the public components also being present,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ensuring that, in `EVP` and in the lower abstraction layers, both in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> legacy and in provider-native codepaths, _every_ instance in which any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> public key component is dereferenced it is preceded by a NULL pointer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> check or guaranteed non-NULL from any caller.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To change the long documented assumption, we commit to improve test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> coverage of all public functions directly or indirectly triggering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> potential access to public key components, to prevent the risk of user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> facing crashes.
