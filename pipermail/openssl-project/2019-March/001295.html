One might, perhaps, try to measure distribution of time between
[pull-request/issue] submission and the first comment on it.
Consider
<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8108">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8108</A>
and
<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/7943">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/7943</A> (both submitted by users that
are now project members), that have both been open for months and still
have no comments!

&gt;<i> &gt; I can't do the same analysis for PRs because github doesn't detect properly when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we merge PRs (because we don't use the github facility for doing that). I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expect to see somewhat similar numbers though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The amount of open pull requests has been around 200 for the last

</I>&gt;<i> but it used to be around 100.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I think that in general we do not have enough resources to keep up
</I>&gt;<i> with both the pull requests and issues.
</I>
Not if we want to keep up the pace of new development towards the goals for
the next major release, I agree.
(Not that I am doing much to contribute, myself, at this point -- my AD
role in the IETF keeps me quite busy.)
