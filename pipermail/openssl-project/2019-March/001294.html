Or that the resources we do have are spend on the wrong thing.

The amount of open pull requests has been around 200 for the last
few months, so it seems we can just keep up with that currently,
but it used to be around 100.

So I think that in general we do not have enough resources to keep up
with both the pull requests and issues.
