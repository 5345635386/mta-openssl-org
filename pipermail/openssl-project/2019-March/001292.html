I don't think this is a fair characterisation. I see all posts to issues and PRs
in github for openssl and I see *lots* of activity.

If I use the github &quot;insights&quot; page I see that over the last month 67 new issues
were raised and 46 were closed. However those numbers are skewed by issues in
very recent days (its shortly after a weekend and neither Richard or myself were
around yesterday). Over the last week 23 new issues were raised and 8 were
closed. Subtracting one from the other I see that for the period 1 week ago to 1
month ago 44 new issues were raised and 38 were closed.

So the real problem there is a mismatch between the opening rate and the closing
rate, i.e. it is NOT that we are ignoring these issues. I see it more as a
resource issue - we are seeing issues raised at a greater rate than we have
resources to handle. The best answer to that IMO is to somehow encourage a
greater participation from the community in helping us to keep on top of these
things. Not sure how best to achieve that though.

I can't do the same analysis for PRs because github doesn't detect properly when
we merge PRs (because we don't use the github facility for doing that). I would
expect to see somewhat similar numbers though.
