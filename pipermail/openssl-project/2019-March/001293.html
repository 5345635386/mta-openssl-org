<PRE>I agree with Matt.  He and Richard are doing a great job but cannot quite keep up.  They are doing a fantastic job given the time available to them.

I&#8217;ve been a bit slack the last two weeks and will be so for the next four or so but I&#8217;ll attempt to catch up.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think this is a fair characterisation. I see all posts to issues and PRs

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I use the github &quot;insights&quot; page I see that over the last month 67 new issues

</I>&gt;<i> very recent days (its shortly after a weekend and neither Richard or myself were
</I>&gt;<i> around yesterday). Over the last week 23 new issues were raised and 8 were
</I>&gt;<i> closed. Subtracting one from the other I see that for the period 1 week ago to 1
</I>&gt;<i> month ago 44 new issues were raised and 38 were closed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the real problem there is a mismatch between the opening rate and the closing
</I>&gt;<i> rate, i.e. it is NOT that we are ignoring these issues. I see it more as a
</I>&gt;<i> resource issue - we are seeing issues raised at a greater rate than we have
</I>&gt;<i> resources to handle. The best answer to that IMO is to somehow encourage a
</I>&gt;<i> greater participation from the community in helping us to keep on top of these
</I>&gt;<i> things. Not sure how best to achieve that though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't do the same analysis for PRs because github doesn't detect properly when
</I>&gt;<i> we merge PRs (because we don't use the github facility for doing that). I would
</I>&gt;<i> expect to see somewhat similar numbers though.
