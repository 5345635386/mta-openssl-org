Yes, I think that would be a really good idea. At least then its very
visible what is happening.

The only thing I could see in that PR was a message from the author
saying that they would submit a CLA. There doesn't seem to be a message
saying that the CLA had actually been processed.

It's not sufficient for the author to *say* they have submitted a CLA.
It must actually have been submitted, and accepted and be on file.
Sometimes there are problems with submitted CLAs (e.g. missing fields,
or a user sends an ICLA when they really also need a CCLA, etc).
Normally the git hooks would not allow you to push a commit where the
author does not have a CLA. However those checks are suppressed where
&quot;CLA: trivial&quot; appears in the commit description. So we need to be extra
careful in that case, i.e. perhaps we should insist that commits
containing &quot;CLA: trivial&quot; have the line removed if we don't think the
commit really is trivial. This ensures that the git hooks do their job
and we can be absolutely sure that the author has a registered CLA.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The commit description contained &quot;CLA: trivial&quot; and so the &quot;hold: cla
