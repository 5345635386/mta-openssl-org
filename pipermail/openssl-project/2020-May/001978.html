Yes, existing code would be able to cope with that with one important
exception that I am going to talk about below.

&gt;<i> With strict shutdown &quot;on&quot; we treat it as SSL_ERROR_SSL (as now in
</I>&gt;<i> master).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure though what the default should be.
</I>
In case we go with this solution, which would be acceptable I think, we
MUST NOT EVER make it the default because existing applications that
depend on the existing way how the unclean EOF condition is returned
might actually depend on it to detect the truncation attack.

The existing legacy way does not really prevent applications from
detecting the truncation attack because the condition is reported to
the application albeit in this legacy undocumented way. So changing the
default to mean - never report the unclean EOF condition at all, simply
return as if the shutdown was clean, would actually mean a security
issue for these existing applications that care about the unclean EOF.

So yes, perhaps it would be better for the SSL_OP to actually fully
ignore the unclean EOF instead of returning this undocumented error
condition, but it must not be a default (not even in SSL_OP_ALL).
