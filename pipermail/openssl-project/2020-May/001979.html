Of course, just adding a call to get the old behaviour back is a
very easy change. But I currently don't see how a different error
is that much more complicated.

It's not because we can't think of any other case that there aren't
any.

I also have a problem with checking errno being 0. We don't set
errno. There is no reason to assume that errno is set to any
value. errno can be modified on a succesful call. That errno is 0
is just a coincidence. If we're going to document that, we should
actually make sure that that is the case.

I think the other property of the old behaviour is that we don't
add anything to the error stack.

&gt;<i> So I would be just for properly documenting the condition and keeping
</I>&gt;<i> it as is if the SSL_OP to ignore unclean EOF is in effect.
</I>
And also don't add an option for applications that do want to get
a fatal error?
