</I>
Actually the coincidence is that the errno is set to 0 on EOF. So yes,
we should explicitly clear the errno on EOF so any leftover value from
previous calls does not affect this.

&gt;<i> I think the other property of the old behaviour is that we don't

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I would be just for properly documenting the condition and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keeping
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it as is if the SSL_OP to ignore unclean EOF is in effect.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And also don't add an option for applications that do want to get
</I>&gt;<i> a fatal error?
</I>
Why another option? That would be the default behavior.

But anyway I like the Matt's proposal even more.
