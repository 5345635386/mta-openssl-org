This is an excellent summary of the current situation.

I am not keen on maintaining the SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL with 0 errno as a
long term solution. It's a very confusing API for new applications to
use. Effectively it means SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL is a fatal error - except
when its not. SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL should mean fatal error.

That said I also recognise that it is apparently commonplace to shut
down a TLS connection without sending close_notify - despite what the
standards may say about it (and TBH we can hardly claim the moral high
ground here since s_server does exactly this - or at least it does in
1.1.1 and did until very recently in master).

But we do have to consider usages beyond HTTPS. I have no idea if this
occurs in other settings or not.

Perhaps what we need is an option for &quot;strict shutdown&quot;. With strict
shutdown &quot;off&quot; we could treat EOF as if we had received a close_notify
gracefully (and don't invalidate the session). Presumably existing code
would be able to cope with that???

With strict shutdown &quot;on&quot; we treat it as SSL_ERROR_SSL (as now in master).

I'm not sure though what the default should be.
