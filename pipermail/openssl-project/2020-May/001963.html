<PRE>Last month I started a script to ping stale PRs that were in certain
states.  The script has also been collecting statistics (trending and
snapshot).  I intend to post this monthly and after a few months with
trends and commentary.

PRs that have not had any updates in the last 30 days and are not WIP:

all  ( 148 issues, median  188  days) of which:

  failed CI  ( 23 issues, median  175  days)
  deferred after 1.1.1  ( 41 issues, median  188  days)
  cla required  ( 19 issues, median  422  days)
  waiting for reporter  ( 15 issues, median  275  days)
  waiting for review  ( 1 issues, median  38  days)
  waiting for OMC  ( 2 issues, median  112.0  days)
  waiting for OTC  ( 1 issues, median  84  days)
  all other  ( 46 issues, median  239.5  days)

So, ignoring deferred issues too you could summarise this as:

    Stale PRs waiting for us to do something: 27 (last months: 29)
    Stale PRs waiting for the reporter to do something: 34 (last months: 37)
    Stale PRs with unclear next action: 46 (last months: 42)

Over time I hope we can triage the &quot;all other&quot; PRs with labels so we
know what the next action is on each one.

Details:
