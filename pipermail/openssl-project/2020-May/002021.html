I think there should be a vote. IMO such a significant break should be
done as a result of a positive decision and not on the basis of a very
small number of people approving a PR.

I can see arguments both ways for it being an OTC vote or an OMC vote.
To an extent it is purely a technical decision i.e. to answer the
question: &quot;does it technically make sense to make this change?&quot;

It also has a business requirements aspect to it i.e. to answer the
question &quot;would this have such a significant impact on the OpenSSL user
base that, regardless of its technical merits, we still shouldn't do it?&quot;

On reflection though I'm not sure that the technical merits of this are
particularly controversial. So I'm thinking that the OMC is still the
right forum for this. However if someone else thinks that the
*technical* arguments are controversial there is no reason why we
couldn't have an OTC vote *as well*. I won't be proposing that though.
