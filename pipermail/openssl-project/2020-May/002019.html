I do not understand this to be a 'feature requirement' - IMO if this
was a 'feature requirement' it would mean that OMC decides that
something must be implemented in such and such way that the OpenSSL 3.0
does this and that as a feature. But we do not do that for every
feature that is being added to master. So I do not even think this
requires any formal vote, unless someone from OTC or OMC calls for it
explicitly.

Of course it is kind-of API break but again I do not think every API
break in OpenSSL 3.0 was voted upon by OMC.

I mean I am definitely not against having a vote if someone feels it
should be done but if nobody requires it, I do not think it would be a
violation of anything if this is merged without a vote.

No matter how far down the wrong road you've gone, turn back.
