AFAIK this is not the case.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why not?  I understand build process is always handled by Matt and Richard (despite many attempts in the past to expand this), but I think if Oracle or Akamai can't &quot;force a change&quot; then it seems to me that the OMC shouldn't either.
</I>
The only reason to have the &quot;no two reviewers from the same company&quot; policy is
to avoid a potential conflict of interest, i.e. where the interests of said
company conflict with the interests of openssl, two people from the same company
could collude to push a change through. In the case of the fellows, they
represent the project directly so there can be no conflict.
