Does this also apply to non-committers submitting a PR being the same
company as one of the two required reviewers? I would have a problem if
there was only a single review required for non-committers but given
there are two reviews required one of them being from OMC member I
would not see much conflict of interest.

+1 - I also don't see the reasons for conflict of interest applying to
fellows.

No matter how far down the wrong road you've gone, turn back.
