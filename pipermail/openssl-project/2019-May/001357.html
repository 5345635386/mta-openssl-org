That's not the way I've ever thought of it. In my mind an approval is for a
change applied to a specific branch. Where a PR lists more than one branch in it
and you approve the PR then effectively you are approving it multiple times all
in one go - once for each branch.

</I>
No. If the PR was approved for master and applied to master then no problem - it
stays in master. If it is later realised that it needs to be backported to other
branches then, yes, new approvals need to be sought for that change to *those
branches*.

As far as I was aware we've always done this.

This is essential in my mind. A change for one branch does not always make sense
in another branch. So you can't just say &quot;I approve this change&quot; and *then*
worry about what branches it applies to. A change only makes sense in the
context of the branch it applies to.
