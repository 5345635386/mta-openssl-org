<PRE>There hasn't been a vote about this, however both Shane and I have committed to not approve each other's PRs.

I also asked Richard if this could be mechanically enforced, which I expect will happen eventually.

Subject: Re: No two reviewers from same company

    &gt; I understand that OpenSSL is changing things so that, by mechanism (and maybe by
    &gt; policy although it&#8217;s not published yet), two members of the same company cannot
    &gt; approve the same PR.  That&#8217;s great.  (I never approved Akamai requests unless it
    &gt; was trivial back when I was on the OMC.)
    
    No such decision has been made as far as I know although it has been discussed
    at various times.

In private email, and <A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8886#issuecomment-494624313">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8886#issuecomment-494624313</A> the implication is that this was a policy.
    
    &gt; Should this policy be extended to OpenSSL&#8217;s fellows?
    
    IMO, no.

Why not?  I understand build process is always handled by Matt and Richard (despite many attempts in the past to expand this), but I think if Oracle or Akamai can't &quot;force a change&quot; then it seems to me that the OMC shouldn't either.
