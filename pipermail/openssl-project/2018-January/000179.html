</I>
Understood.  Hopefully the bits I did last week helped with the
triage.

I mostly was just not sure if this has always been the policy, or if
there was a period of time when things were much more haphazard as
we first started using github.  Going forward I expect that we'll be
in better shape.

&gt;<i> To be absolutely sure though I just re-reviewed all of those issues
</I>&gt;<i> against the 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 milestones (there weren't that many of
</I>&gt;<i> them), to make sure I got them right. I made 2 or 3 changes including to
</I>&gt;<i> the issue you highlighted (moving it to the &quot;Post 1.1.1&quot; milestone).
</I>
Thank you; I do appreciate it!

&gt;<i> Feel free to make any other adjustments you think might be necessary as
</I>&gt;<i> you come across them.
</I>
Okay.  I may try to look at the 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 issues, but really
ought to finish up the draft-23 support PR first :)

&gt;<i> Although there may be some disagreements on a few of the issues. I am
</I>&gt;<i> confident that the milestones as they are currently set are broadly
</I>&gt;<i> correct - and a good basis for planning.
</I>
We should probably revive the release timeline/planning thread now,
yes.
