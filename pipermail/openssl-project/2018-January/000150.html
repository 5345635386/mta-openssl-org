IMHO a light-weight configuration option like this falls under the same
exception.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - is a new config option a new feature?  I have argued that it is, but
</I>&gt;<i>    am not at all sure we have a consensus.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - is a new C macro to indicate if a certain feature is desirable or
</I>&gt;<i>    not a new feature?  I actually have no clue, which is also the
</I>&gt;<i>    reason I raised the question in the PR.
</I>&gt;<i>    A side question is why this was coded as a direct C macro
</I>&gt;<i>    configuration and not as our other config options, and in that case,
</I>&gt;<i>    why we should consider it differently from the usual config options.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
a) It should not influence the exported functions or the header files in
any way.

b) It should not add any complexity (and future maintenance cost) to
the configuration process.

c) A &quot;normal&quot; config option would cross the border to a new feature.


Thanks
Bernd.
