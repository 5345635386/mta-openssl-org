<PRE>&gt;<i> - is a new config target a new feature?  I think that most of us have
</I>&gt;<i>   agreed that it is, but am not entirely sure everyone sees it that
</I>&gt;<i>   way.
</I>
At the same time one can argue that rules don't have to be as rigid for
LTS. It's appropriate to &quot;entice&quot; people to use latest version, but at
the same time we actually recognize that it's not actually reasonable to
unconditionally *demand* that they do. How do we do that? By maintaining
LTS concept itself. Now, one of OpenSSL's strong sides is that it's
multi-platform, i.e. facilitates common applications across multiple
platforms. And on certain level denial of new platform support actually
contradicts LTS concept. Because it prevents stable application code
reuse. Do note &quot;don't have to be as rigid for LTS&quot; in the beginning. It
doesn't mean that we should be open to *any* suggestion, only that we
don't have be closed to *every* one of them. To give a practical
example, consider Android clang problem... [I refer to the fact that
they plan to remove gcc from ndk.]
