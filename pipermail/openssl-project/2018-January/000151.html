<PRE>I'll start by saying I'm generally in agreement.


&gt;<i> - is a new config target a new feature?  I think that most of us have
</I>&gt;<i>   agreed that it is, but am not entirely sure everyone sees it that
</I>&gt;<i>   way.
</I>
I would say that it is a new feature too.


&gt;<i> - is a new config option a new feature?  I have argued that it is, but
</I>&gt;<i>   am not at all sure we have a consensus.
</I>
I'd tend to think of it as a new feature.  However, I'd allow an obvious API that was omitted.


&gt;<i> - is a new C macro to indicate if a certain feature is desirable or
</I>&gt;<i>   not a new feature?  I actually have no clue, which is also the
</I>&gt;<i>   reason I raised the question in the PR.
</I>&gt;<i>   A side question is why this was coded as a direct C macro
</I>&gt;<i>   configuration and not as our other config options, and in that case,
</I>&gt;<i>   why we should consider it differently from the usual config options.
</I>
If it were a new function instead of a macro would it be included?
Does it pass the test of being a fairly obvious function that is missing?
Without additional context, a feature test would seem to qualify as a fix.
