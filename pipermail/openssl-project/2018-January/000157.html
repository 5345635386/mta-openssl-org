<PRE>&gt;<i> Oh heck, we&#8217;re gonna get wrapped around the axle of wording again&#8230;
</I>
??? Humans communicate with words. If we are to agree on something,
words is *all* we have to use. And wordings have meanings too...

&gt;&gt;<i>    This is confusing. For starters it's mixing up two completely different
</I>&gt;<i>     things. It's one thing to make availability of *legacy* crypto (or
</I>&gt;<i>     protocol) an option, it's another thing to *introduce* insecure options.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Disagree.  That&#8217;s just an implementation detail.  From the end-user&#8217;s perspective, weakness is weakness no matter where or how it comes from.
</I>
Let me rephrase. &quot;It's another thing to *purposefully* introduce options
known to be insecure by the time of introduction.&quot; [I actually written
&quot;known to be insecure by time&quot; in original draft, but later thought that
it's implied by word &quot;introduce&quot;.] Well, arguably there is ambiguity in
use of word &quot;option&quot;. Is it a config-time switch, or code it controls? I
obviously refer to code.

&gt;&gt;<i> Now, does
</I>&gt;<i>     wording mean that omc is actually open to suggestions to *introduce*
</I>&gt;<i>     insecure options?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> That wasn&#8217;t the intent.  It could happen.
</I>
I'm sorry [for taking the risk to irritate you even more with
&quot;irrelevant wording&quot; stuff], but what does *this* mean? &quot;That wasn't the
intent. [But] it [,insecure options,] could happen [anyway].&quot;? This
would mean affirmative answer to the question. Is this it? Or was it
&quot;That wasn't the intent. It [wording] just happened.&quot;?
