</I>
That *is* the intent. What I've done here is *triage* - spending a few
minutes on each one to assess the correct milestone. It would not
surprise me to learn that, having done that for over 380 issues, we
might have come to a different assessment on a few of them. :-)

To be absolutely sure though I just re-reviewed all of those issues
against the 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 milestones (there weren't that many of
them), to make sure I got them right. I made 2 or 3 changes including to
the issue you highlighted (moving it to the &quot;Post 1.1.1&quot; milestone).
Feel free to make any other adjustments you think might be necessary as
you come across them.

The primary objective here is to inform the debate on the release
criteria for 1.1.1 and the associated timeframes. You will recall that
one of the proposed criteria was:

&quot;- All open github issues/PRs older than 2 weeks at the time of release
to be assessed for relevance to 1.1.1. Any flagged with the 1.1.1
milestone to be closed (see below)

...

Valid reasons for closing an issue/PR with a 1.1.1 milestone might be:
- We have just now or sometime in the past fixed the issue
- Unable to reproduce (following discussion with original reporter if
possible)
- Working as intended
- Deliberate decision not to fix until a later release
- Not enough information and unable to contact reporter
- etc&quot;

We then got into discussions about timeframes - which was difficult
without knowing the scope of the work.

Although there may be some disagreements on a few of the issues. I am
confident that the milestones as they are currently set are broadly
correct - and a good basis for planning.
