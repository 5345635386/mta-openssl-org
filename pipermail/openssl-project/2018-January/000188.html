<PRE>So a few months into it, we look at changing the schedule if we need to stretch thing out.

    &gt; A monthly release cadence for beta seems too long.  I would prefer two weeks.  And we keep doing that until TLS 1.3 is published.
    
    That might be ok. As a technical issue though we can only have a maximum
    of 14 alpha/beta releases (due to the format of OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER
    in opensslv.h). If we were to do a release every 2 weeks starting on
    14th Feb, that would mean the last beta we could possibly do would be on
    15th August.  If there is a risk that the TLSv1.3 publication could go
    beyond that date then we would be stuck.

    &gt;     Reviving the 1.1.1 release timetable discussion now that we have a
    &gt;     clearer idea of the scope of outstanding issues/PRs.
    &gt;     
    &gt;     Here is my updated straw man proposal for the 1.1.1 release timetable.
    &gt;     The only changes to this from my original proposal is to shift the dates
    &gt;     (because in my original proposal we would already have done the first
    &gt;     alpha) and I have relabelled the second release as a &quot;beta&quot;. My original
    &gt;     plan called this an alpha with feature freeze at the same time, which
    &gt;     people (vehemently) objected to. :-)
    &gt;     
    &gt;     14th February 2018, alpha release 1 (pre1)
    &gt;     14th March 2018, beta release 1 (pre2)
    &gt;     	OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable created (feature freeze)
    &gt;     	master becomes basis for 1.1.2 or 1.2.0 (TBD)
    &gt;     11th March 2018, beta release 2 (pre3)
    &gt;     9th May 2018, 1.1.1 public release (assuming TLSv1.3 RFC is published)
    &gt;     
    &gt;     An alpha release means:
    &gt;     - Not (necessarily) feature complete
    &gt;     - Not necessarily all new APIs in place yet
    &gt;     
    &gt;     A beta release means:
    &gt;     - Feature complete/Feature freeze
    &gt;     - Bug fixes only
    &gt;     
    &gt;     My proposed release criteria are:
    &gt;     - All open github issues/PRs older than 2 weeks at the time of release
    &gt;     to be assessed for relevance to 1.1.1. Any flagged with the 1.1.1
    &gt;     milestone to be closed (see below)
    &gt;     - Clean builds in Travis and Appveyor for two days
    &gt;     - run-checker.sh to be showing as clean 2 days before release
    &gt;     - No open Coverity issues (not flagged as &quot;False Positive&quot; or &quot;Ignore&quot;)
    &gt;     - TLSv1.3 RFC published
    &gt;     
    &gt;     Valid reasons for closing an issue/PR with a 1.1.1 milestone might be:
    &gt;     - We have just now or sometime in the past fixed the issue
    &gt;     - Unable to reproduce (following discussion with original reporter if
    &gt;     possible)
    &gt;     - Working as intended
    &gt;     - Deliberate decision not to fix until a later release (this wouldn't
    &gt;     actually close the issue/PR but change the milestone instead)
    &gt;     - Not enough information and unable to contact reporter
    &gt;     - etc
    &gt;     
    &gt;     This plan gives us 2 months from feature freeze to get all issues and
    &gt;     PRs with the 1.1.1 milestone closed (or assigned to a different
    &gt;     milestone). Currently this stands at 141 issues and 55 PRs. In practice
    &gt;     I think the only way we get through that lot is to make explicit
    &gt;     decisions not to fix/implement some of them and change the milestone.
    &gt;     But I think making explicit decisions about these rather than just
    &gt;     letting them drift indefinitely is a good thing.
    &gt;     
    &gt;     If the TLSv1.3 RFC is not published by the time we are ready to release,
    &gt;     or we haven't made the progress we want on the other release criteria
    &gt;     then we can add additional betas as we see fit until such time as we are
    &gt;     ready.
