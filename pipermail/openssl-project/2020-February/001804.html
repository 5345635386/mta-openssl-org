Well - it isn't stable *right now*. Its in development. But moving
forward the provider model *is* the way we intend to go. By the time of
the 3.0 release the provider stuff had better be stable, otherwise we've
gone wrong.

As has been pointed out many times. Deprecation does not mean removal
(yet). Its just a signal that at some later time we will remove it.

And the 3.0 is the right time to signal that. We don't want to hold on
the &quot;legacy&quot; codepaths for any longer than we have to. They were only
ever originally intended to be temporary, and to be removed before 3.0
got released. However it now looks like they will live beyond the 3.0
release. They should not live for any longer than absolutely necessary.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The main benefits seem to boil down to continuing to support

</I>&gt;<i>     the provider model.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For me, both as open-source and commercial engine developer seems

</I>
That's a perfectly reasonable strategy. But this decision is independent
of whether we deprecate the ENGINE APIs in 3.0 or not. It would be
perfectly ok for people to continue to *use* engines in 3.0 even though
they are deprecated.


&gt;<i> But some features I'm interested in imply engine model (and it will be
</I>&gt;<i> great if somebody else could look at PR 10904 to avoid it when possible).
</I>
If there are gaps then we need to plug them. The provider model should
be able to do everything that you can do now in ENGINEs.
