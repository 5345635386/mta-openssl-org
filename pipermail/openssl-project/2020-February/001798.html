I do not understand the pushback too much - Perhaps it could be
resolved by proper explanation that deprecation does not mean a
removal?

Also even if some stuff deprecated in 3.0 is removed in 4.0, it does
not necessarily mean that engines must be removed in the same release.
They can continue to be supported (just deprecated) until 5.0 for
example.

I think that doing the deprecation as early as possible is better - it
properly gives the signal that the engine interface is legacy and it
will disappear at some point. It provides more time for 3rd party
engines to transform into providers.
