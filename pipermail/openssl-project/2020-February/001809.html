</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     There is some pushback against the deprecations going on in various

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     The plan has always been to deprecate engines in 3.0 and removing
</I>&gt;<i> support for them 5+ years later.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Originally, the path was to have included an engine provider that
</I>&gt;<i> could load engines and make them appear
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     to be a provider.  After a fair amount of investigation, this was
</I>&gt;<i> deemed to be too difficult in the 3.0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     time frame.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Do we still want to deprecate engines in 3.0?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Should we defer until 4.0 instead?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think we should delay the deprecation of engine stuff to 4.0.
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I don't have sense of stability of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provider API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It should be pointed out that the engine stuff isn't as stable as you
</I>&gt;<i> might think, because it shares internal structures with libcrypto.
</I>&gt;<i> Even if we handle those structures via function calls, all it takes is
</I>&gt;<i> loading an engine linked against - say - 1.1.0 in 1.1.1 to run a real
</I>&gt;<i> risk of a spectacular KABOOM if any of the structure that are touched
</I>&gt;<i> changed between those OpenSSL versions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Does ABI compatibility cover a significant share of these cases?


&gt;<i> This is a consequence of making structures opaque and feeling much
</I>&gt;<i> more liberty in changing them, and we didn't quite pay attention.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The whole model around providers is intentionally designed to allow
</I>&gt;<i> providers to run flexibly with any OpenSSL version, even if they are
</I>&gt;<i> linked with some (possibly different) libcrypto version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the question of stability depends on what you look at.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed.

It's true that some parts of the provider API is fluctuating a bit, as
&gt;<i> early designs need modifications to better meet demands.  We're still
</I>&gt;<i> in development.  Come beta1 (schedule for June), I expect that it will
</I>&gt;<i> have stabilized.  Come the release, it must have.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure.

&gt;<i>     The main benefits seem to boil down to continuing to support existing
</I>&gt;<i> engines vs removing the legacy code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     paths and switching to the provider model.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For me, both as open-source and commercial engine developer seems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reasonable to delay conversion from engines to providers at least
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; until 3.0.0 feature freeze happens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> According to our policy, a deprecation starts at the release that has
</I>&gt;<i> those deprecations, and removal of deprecated stuff can only happen 5
</I>&gt;<i> years later at the earliest.  Seeing deprecations in the source now
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't change that, the clock will start ticking when we release
</I>&gt;<i> 3.0, so consider what you see happening on github as a pre-deprecation
</I>&gt;<i> warning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes.


&gt;<i> &gt; But some features I'm interested in imply engine model (and it will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be great if somebody else could look at PR 10904 to avoid it when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apart from a few details, that PR looks rather innocuous.  I frankly
</I>&gt;<i> haven't had time to look at it too deeply (I just discovered that I
</I>&gt;<i> was prompted), as I haven't dived in the CMS code yet...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, the problem is introducing some new control values. I don't feel
policy here very well.
I also plan to submit at least one TLS-related PR significantly more
innocent...
