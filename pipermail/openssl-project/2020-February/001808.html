</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     There is some pushback against the deprecations going on in various
</I>&gt;<i> PRs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     The plan has always been to deprecate engines in 3.0 and removing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     support for them 5+ years later.  Originally, the path was to have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     included an engine provider that could load engines and make them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     appear to be a provider.  After a fair amount of investigation, this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     was deemed to be too difficult in the 3.0 time frame.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Do we still want to deprecate engines in 3.0?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Should we defer until 4.0 instead?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think we should delay the deprecation of engine stuff to 4.0.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Personally I don't have sense of stability of provider API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well - it isn't stable *right now*. Its in development. But moving
</I>&gt;<i> forward the provider model *is* the way we intend to go. By the time of
</I>&gt;<i> the 3.0 release the provider stuff had better be stable, otherwise we've
</I>&gt;<i> gone wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Totally agree. Though the conversion between engines and providers is not
as straightforward as I want, so I prefer to wait for some time.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As has been pointed out many times. Deprecation does not mean removal
</I>&gt;<i> (yet). Its just a signal that at some later time we will remove it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And the 3.0 is the right time to signal that. We don't want to hold on
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;legacy&quot; codepaths for any longer than we have to. They were only
</I>&gt;<i> ever originally intended to be temporary, and to be removed before 3.0
</I>&gt;<i> got released. However it now looks like they will live beyond the 3.0
</I>&gt;<i> release. They should not live for any longer than absolutely necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmmm. Not sure here. I remember the introduction of EVP_PKEY_ameth/pmeth
currently moving to providers.

&gt;<i>     The main benefits seem to boil down to continuing to support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     existing engines vs removing the legacy code paths and switching to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     the provider model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's worth explaining the benefits to engine authors :)
I understand the benefits of OpenSSL as a product and still now don't have
a firm understanding of benefits for the surrounding ecosystem. Though I
did not dive into the providers deeply.

I still have a suspicion that we will not have function signatures for
callbacks in providers.
Do we? If don't, we'll have a set of errors implementing it.

&gt;<i> For me, both as open-source and commercial engine developer seems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reasonable to delay conversion from engines to providers at least until
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.0.0 feature freeze happens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's a perfectly reasonable strategy. But this decision is independent
</I>&gt;<i> of whether we deprecate the ENGINE APIs in 3.0 or not. It would be
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly ok for people to continue to *use* engines in 3.0 even though
</I>&gt;<i> they are deprecated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure.


&gt;<i> &gt; But some features I'm interested in imply engine model (and it will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; great if somebody else could look at PR 10904 to avoid it when possible).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there are gaps then we need to plug them. The provider model should
</I>&gt;<i> be able to do everything that you can do now in ENGINEs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Totally agree.
