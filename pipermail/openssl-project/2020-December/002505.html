The only one who knows whether or not a given parameter is critically
important to have been used is the application.
The gettable and settable interfaces provide the ability to check that.

For forward and backward compatibility it makes no sense to wire in a
requirement for complete knowledge of everything that is provided.

You need to be able to provide extra optional parameters that some
implementations want to consume and are entirely irrelevant to
other implementations to have extensibility wired into the APIs and that
was one of the purposes of the new plumbing - to be able to handle things
going forward. If you change things at this late stage to basically say
everything has to know everything then we lose that ability.

In practical terms too, we need to be able to have later releases of
applications able to work with earlier releases of providers (specifically
but not limited to the FIPS provider) and it would practically mean you
could never reach that interchangeable provider context that is there for a
stable ABI - wiring in a requirement to be aware of all parameters will
simply lead to provider implementations needing to ignore things to achieve
the necessary outcome.

If you want to know if a specific implementation is aware of something, the
interface is already there.

In short - I don't see an issue as there is a way to check, and the
interface is designed for forward and backward compatibility and that is
more important than the various items raised here so far IMHO.
