<PRE>Greetings OpenSSL folks!

The OMC met this past weekend.  Much was accomplished.  Per our policy, we&#8217;re telling the project that the following votes are now active among the OMC.  As the votes are concluded, more information (blog posts, website updates, whatever&#8217;s appropriate) will be made available.

VOTE: openssl-web and tools repositories shall be under the same review policy as per the openssl repository where the reviewers are OMC members

VOTE: That we remove &quot;We strongly believe that the right to advance patches/info should not be based in any way on paid membership to  some forum. You cannot pay us to get security patches in advance&quot; from the security policy and Mark posts a blog entry to explain the change including that we have no current such service.

VOTE: 1.1.1 beta release schedule changed so that the next two beta releases are now 29th May, 19 June and we will re-review release readiness after that. We will also ensure that there is at least one beta release post TLS-1.3 RFC publication prior to the final release.

VOTE: Remove the entire &quot;Forthcoming Features&quot; section from the Roadmap Policy and open github issues for those items listed which have not yet been completed and do not currently have issues raised or PR submitted.

VOTE: We don't intend to be involved in adding any additional platforms to the OpenSSL FIPS validation; instead we will work to enable other parties to meet this need.

VOTE: The next LTS release will be 1.1.1 and the LTS expiry date for 1.0.2 will not be changed.
