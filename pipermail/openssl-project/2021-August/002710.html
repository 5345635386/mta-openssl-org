<PRE>On the other hand, 1.1.1 is not in its last year of support so it is not
limited to security fixes only.

The commits which this vote proposes to revert fixed a bug that produced
invalid output from functions with a clear intent.
This might have security repercussions, as the user might end up signing
something which is unexpectedly invalid.
But even without concrete security vulnerabilities on record, if we
classify invalid output as a bug this should be fixed in 1.1.1.

There are applications that might be broken, because they relied on the
buggy behavior for producing invalid output as intermediate data, but, as
mentioned in #16266, there are ways of producing the required non-x509 data
without abusing functions meant to produce valid x509.

It is unfortunate for existing applications to break upon a patch release,
but given that patch releases for 1.1.1 are meant to fix security defects
and bugs, this is inevitable for any application relying on buggy behavior
(especially as in the case that triggered this discussion, which configures
a clear abuse of the API, while alternative non-abusive ways of achieving
the intended result exist).
