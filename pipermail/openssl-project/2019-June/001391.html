&gt;<i> So while this is an issue for *us*, it isn't necessarily an issue for
</I>&gt;<i> our users, all depending on what C language version they use.
</I>
Supporting things *we* can&#8217;t use seems a little odd.  The alternative construction is about as onerous (the construct calls).  On stack arrays won&#8217;t provide much performance benefit.  Static arrays would but without thread safety.


&gt;&gt;<i> With most OSSL_PARAM structure being dynamically created,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the need for the indirection seems redundant.  E.g. could the return length be moved into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OSSL_PARAM?  I think so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The design was not only to be able to have nice compile time
</I>&gt;<i> initialization, but also to be able to pass the array as 'const
</I>&gt;<i> OSSL_PARAM *', i.e. an indication to the recipient that the array
</I>&gt;<i> itself should never be modified (less chance of compromise).  Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> that's overly paranoid, but that was a line of thinking.
</I>
This is a better reason, not that I think &#8220;const&#8221; is all that useful here.

An aside: having a const struct that has a pointer to non-const memory isn&#8217;t entirely obvious to many.  This is a public API, make it as simple as necessary.


&gt;&gt;<i> Moving integral values into the structure is more difficult because BIGNUMs will always need to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> references.  Allocating additional memory will still be required.  I&#8217;ve got three obvious
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solutions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. include a void * in the OSSL_PARAM structure that needs to be freed when the structure is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> destroyed or
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's actually perfectly possible to do this today.  We already have
</I>&gt;<i> this pointer, it's called 'data&#8217;.
</I>
And how is a pointer known to be malloced or not?  I&#8217;m trying to make this easy for users without losing the efficiency that is possible if it is required somewhere.

I&#8217;m looking at making this kind of code work:

OSSL_PARAMS params[10];
int n = 0, max_len;
char my_size[20];

scanf(&#8220;%d&#8221;, &amp;max_len);
params[n++] = OSSL_PARAM_construct_utf8_string(&#8220;size&#8221;, &amp;my_size, sizeof(my_size), NULL);
params[n++] = OSSL_PARAM_construct_utf8_string(&#8220;name&#8221;, NULL, max_len, NULL);
params[n++] = OSSL_PARAM_construct_end();

&#8230;

OSSL_PARAM_deconstruct_all(params);

It is a contrived case but I think it would make using the params easier.


&gt;&gt;<i> 2. have a block of data in the OSSL_PARAM structure that can be used for native types
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (OSSL_UNION_ALIGN works perfectly for this) or
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My major concern with that, apart from having to modify the OSSL_PARAM
</I>&gt;<i> items themselves&#184; is that some time in the future, we will want to add
</I>&gt;<i> another native type that's larger, which means we modify the size of a
</I>&gt;<i> OSSL_PARAM.  It's a public structure, so that can't be treated
</I>&gt;<i> lightly.
</I>
This is a valid concern.  OSSL_UNION_ALIGN isn&#8217;t appropriate.
Likewise, uintmax_t isn&#8217;t binary compatible.


&gt;<i> If you're thinking that the receiving side should free certain values,
</I>&gt;<i> then you need to pass a pointer to the routine to be used to free the
</I>&gt;<i> value rather than just a flag.
</I>
I agree, this is a bad idea.  

The API isn&#8217;t easy to use at the moment.  It is also error prone as soon as something complex is encountered (which we haven&#8217;t yet).
Shane struggled to figure this out and get it working when trying the KDFs and he is far more experienced than most.


I&#8217;ll see if I can get some kind of diff or PR together.
