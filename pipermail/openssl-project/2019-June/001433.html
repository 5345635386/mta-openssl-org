<PRE>I agree with everything Richard just said. I just have some additional thoughts
inserted below.

</I>
I think you missed another important perspective, i.e. that of the end user.

Note that this is slightly different to the needs of the application author. An
application author will typically do one of two things if an error occurs:

1) Try and figure out the cause of the error and recover from it, e.g. if I get
reason code x then I'll retry the operation with slightly different parameters
but if I get y then I'll just ignore this failure and carry on anyway.

or

2) If its an error they don't know how to handle then give up and display
whatever error details are available to the end user (or log them, or whatever)

So the application author is going to want a small number of reason codes that
they can handle. If its not in the small set they know about, then give up.

The end user OTOH doesn't care about reason codes at all and wants as detailed
an explanation of the error (in text form) as is possible. Potentially that
might mean different text for every point in the code where we raise an error.
Ideally they might want information about the context that led up to the error,
i.e. what particular operation was being attempted at the time. I'm thinking
that there is some relationship here between the information available from the
trace API, and the error API.


&gt;<i> What I would like to see is a simplified error system that delivers
</I>&gt;<i> reason codes, and attached extra text information.  That text
</I>&gt;<i> information could have two parts, where one is debugging information
</I>&gt;<i> (__FILE__, __LINE__, __FUNC__, and possibly exact commit hash

</I>&gt;<i> and the other is the extra data added with the likes of

</I>&gt;<i> We certainly already have the infrastructure to allow this, the

</I>
+1 to this.
