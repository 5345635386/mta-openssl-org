If NULL is passed as return_size, it means the owner isn't interested
in the size (this is obviously the case when the OSSL_PARAM array is
to be used with a set_params type of call, but may also be true in a
get_params type of call if the owner knows the expected size through
some other means, such as a parameter being documented to *always* be
a 32-bit integer, or for a OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING where the ending NUL
byte is always trustable)

But you're talking about allocating the whole OSSL_PARAM array on the
heap, aren't you?  While not structly opposed (even though I think
that's wasteful), I think this should be done with a separate set of
functions (intuitively, having names with '_alloc_' rather than
'_construct_' could be an idea).

</I>&gt;<i>             parallel with the OSSL_PARAM.
</I>&gt;<i>            
</I>&gt;<i>             The extra indirection was intended to support const arrays of OSSL_PARAM, which turn

</I>&gt;<i>             being dynamically created, the need for the indirection seems redundant.  E.g. could

</I>&gt;<i>             2. have a block of data in the OSSL_PARAM structure that can be used for native types
</I>&gt;<i>             (OSSL_UNION_ALIGN works perfectly for this) or
</I>&gt;<i>             3. add a flag field to the OSSL_PARAM to indicate that the referenced value needs to
</I>&gt;<i>             be freed.
</I>&gt;<i>            
</I>&gt;<i>             The memory allocation comes to the for when reading e.g. a file and extracting data &#8213;
</I>&gt;<i>             either the reader needs a lot of local variables to hold everything or it has to
</I>&gt;<i>             allocated for each.  The file&#8217;s data is transient in memory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>             For the most part, the receiver side APIs seem reasonable.  It is the owning side that
</I>&gt;<i>             has the complications.
</I>&gt;<i>            
</I>&gt;<i>             I think I might be able come up with some owner side routines that assist here but
