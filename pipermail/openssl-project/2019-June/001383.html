<PRE>Shane&#8217;s major complaints are about the indirection the OSSL_PARAM structure forces &#8212; for integers and return lengths and the necessity of allocating additional memory in parallel with the OSSL_PARAM.

The extra indirection was intended to support const arrays of OSSL_PARAM, which turn out to be a rarity because they aren&#8217;t thread safe.  With most OSSL_PARAM structure being dynamically created, the need for the indirection seems redundant.  E.g. could the return length be moved into OSSL_PARAM?  I think so.

Moving integral values into the structure is more difficult because BIGNUMs will always need to be references.  Allocating additional memory will still be required.  I&#8217;ve got three obvious solutions:

1. include a void * in the OSSL_PARAM structure that needs to be freed when the structure is destroyed or
2. have a block of data in the OSSL_PARAM structure that can be used for native types (OSSL_UNION_ALIGN works perfectly for this) or
3. add a flag field to the OSSL_PARAM to indicate that the referenced value needs to be freed.

The memory allocation comes to the for when reading e.g. a file and extracting data &#8212; either the reader needs a lot of local variables to hold everything or it has to allocated for each.  The file&#8217;s data is transient in memory.


For the most part, the receiver side APIs seem reasonable.  It is the owning side that has the complications.

I think I might be able come up with some owner side routines that assist here but allowing changes to the params structure would be far easier.


I kind of like using the OSSL_PARAM arrays as a replacement for string ctrl functions if not ctrl as well (subject to backward compatibility concerns).
