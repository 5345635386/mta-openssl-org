<PRE>Aside from the discussion below, if there's one thing I would like to
change, it the double indirection for the _PTR data types.  The data
types could still be used to indicate that the value isn't short
lived, but could possibly change names to something like
OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_CSTRING and OSSL_PARAM_OCTET_CSTRING (C for Constant).

</I>
The reason why we have this issue is our base C language version
choice.  C90 doesn't allow this construct:

    int foo(whatever)
    {
        int haha = 0;
        const OSSL_PARAM params[] = {
            { 'foo', OSSL_PARAM_INTEGER, &amp;haha, sizeof(haha), NULL },
            { NULL, 0, NULL, 0, NULL }
        };

        ...
    }

Because the compiler for that language version isn't allowed to emit
code to use '&amp;haha' in an inititializer.  Newer C language versions
allow this.

So while this is an issue for *us*, it isn't necessarily an issue for
our users, all depending on what C language version they use.

&gt;<i> With most OSSL_PARAM structure being dynamically created,
</I>&gt;<i> the need for the indirection seems redundant.  E.g. could the return length be moved into
</I>&gt;<i> OSSL_PARAM?  I think so.
</I>
The design was not only to be able to have nice compile time
initialization, but also to be able to pass the array as 'const
OSSL_PARAM *', i.e. an indication to the recipient that the array
itself should never be modified (less chance of compromise).  Maybe
that's overly paranoid, but that was a line of thinking.

&gt;<i> Moving integral values into the structure is more difficult because BIGNUMs will always need to be
</I>&gt;<i> references.  Allocating additional memory will still be required.  I&#8217;ve got three obvious
</I>&gt;<i> solutions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. include a void * in the OSSL_PARAM structure that needs to be freed when the structure is
</I>&gt;<i> destroyed or
</I>
It's actually perfectly possible to do this today.  We already have
this pointer, it's called 'data'.

&gt;<i> 2. have a block of data in the OSSL_PARAM structure that can be used for native types
</I>&gt;<i> (OSSL_UNION_ALIGN works perfectly for this) or
</I>
My major concern with that, apart from having to modify the OSSL_PARAM
items themselves&#184; is that some time in the future, we will want to add
another native type that's larger, which means we modify the size of a
OSSL_PARAM.  It's a public structure, so that can't be treated
lightly.

Also, with a union of native types, we're losing uniformity on MSB
first platforms.  Having an exact 1:1 integer size match will be
crucial, and that complicates the code quite a bit...  not to mention
that we have a compatibility problem as soon as one end has a new
native type in the union and the other doesn't.
(one would imagine that simply using uintmax_t would cover all integer
sizes apart from BIGNUM, but the potential size change of that type
with newer compilers make such a choice precarious)

&gt;<i> 3. add a flag field to the OSSL_PARAM to indicate that the referenced value needs to be freed.
</I>
By whom?  The owner of the array should be in complete control of
what's needed already, so should be able to know what needs being
deallocated or not.

If you're thinking that the receiving side should free certain values,
then you need to pass a pointer to the routine to be used to free the
value rather than just a flag.

&gt;<i> The memory allocation comes to the for when reading e.g. a file and extracting data &#8212; either the
</I>&gt;<i> reader needs a lot of local variables to hold everything or it has to allocated for each.  The
</I>&gt;<i> file&#8217;s data is transient in memory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the most part, the receiver side APIs seem reasonable.  It is the owning side that has the
</I>&gt;<i> complications.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think I might be able come up with some owner side routines that assist here but allowing
</I>&gt;<i> changes to the params structure would be far easier.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I kind of like using the OSSL_PARAM arrays as a replacement for string ctrl functions if not ctrl
</I>&gt;<i> as well (subject to backward compatibility concerns).

</I>&gt;<i>         What changed your mind?
