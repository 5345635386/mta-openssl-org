Good point, but note that there is no conflict with what I wrote.  The
additional information you're talking about is something we currently
provide the ERR_add_error_data() function for, and that together with
the reason text (derived from the reason code) is the data the end
user can reasonably get.  It's up to whoever writes the error raising
code to provide enough useful information.

Incidently, I did mention thinking about a new (better, I hope) error
raising function on github, and might as well repeat it here:

    int ERR_raise_error(int reason, const char *fmt, ...);

To allow for debugging information (like I mentioned, some sensible
combination of __FILE__, __LINE__, __FUNC__, and possibly git commit
id), one might imagine this:

    int ERR_add_debug_info(const char *file, size_t line,
                           const char *func, const char *commitid);

or a combo of both:

    int ERR_raise_error_debug(int reason,
                              const char *file, size_t line,
                              const char *func, const char *commitid,
                              const char *fmt, ...);

Note that this doesn't have to conflict with the current error raising
code, all we need to do is to convert whatever input ERR_put_error()
gets into the new form.

Cheers,
Richard
