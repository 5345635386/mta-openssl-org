Surely, this can be alleviated with a comment or appropriate documentation?

</I>&gt;<i>         solutions:
</I>&gt;<i>        
</I>&gt;<i>         1. include a void * in the OSSL_PARAM structure that needs to be freed when the structure
</I>&gt;<i>         is
</I>&gt;<i>         destroyed or
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     It's actually perfectly possible to do this today.  We already have
</I>&gt;<i>     this pointer, it's called 'data&#8217;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And how is a pointer known to be malloced or not?  I&#8217;m trying to make this easy for users without
</I>&gt;<i> losing the efficiency that is possible if it is required somewhere.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m looking at making this kind of code work:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     OSSL_PARAMS params[10];
</I>&gt;<i>     int n = 0, max_len;
</I>&gt;<i>     char my_size[20];
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i>     scanf(&#8220;%d&#8221;, &amp;max_len);
</I>&gt;<i>     params[n++] = OSSL_PARAM_construct_utf8_string(&#8220;size&#8221;, &amp;my_size, sizeof(my_size), NULL);
</I>&gt;<i>     params[n++] = OSSL_PARAM_construct_utf8_string(&#8220;name&#8221;, NULL, max_len, NULL);
</I>&gt;<i>     params[n++] = OSSL_PARAM_construct_end();
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i>     &#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i>     OSSL_PARAM_deconstruct_all(params);
</I>
Well, going along with the idea of having a separate set of functions
called something with '_alloc_' instead of '_construct_', I could
imagine an interface like this:

    OSSL_PARAM OSSL_PARAM_alloc_utf8_string(const char *name,
                                            void **buf, size_t bufsize,
                                            size_t *return_size);

That would allow the OSSL_PARAM array owner to keep track of allocated
data by passsing in the address to a pointer, and deallocate what
needs to be deallocated after the fact.  Or in other words:

    OSSL_PARAMS params[10];
    int n = 0, max_len;
    char my_size[20];
    void *namebuf = NULL;
   
    scanf(&#8220;%d&#8221;, &amp;max_len);
    params[n++] = OSSL_PARAM_construct_utf8_string(&#8220;size&#8221;, &amp;my_size, sizeof(my_size), NULL);
    params[n++] = OSSL_PARAM_alloc_utf8_string(&#8220;name&#8221;, &amp;namebuf, max_len, NULL);
    params[n++] = OSSL_PARAM_construct_end();
   
    &#8230;
   
    OPENSSL_free(namebuf);

&gt;<i> It is a contrived case but I think it would make using the params easier.
</I>
Not at all contrived, I can see uses for it, but then rather for the
get_params kind of call.

&gt;<i>         2. have a block of data in the OSSL_PARAM structure that can be used for native types
</I>&gt;<i>         (OSSL_UNION_ALIGN works perfectly for this) or
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     My major concern with that, apart from having to modify the OSSL_PARAM
</I>&gt;<i>     items themselves&#184; is that some time in the future, we will want to add
</I>&gt;<i>     another native type that's larger, which means we modify the size of a
</I>&gt;<i>     OSSL_PARAM.  It's a public structure, so that can't be treated
</I>&gt;<i>     lightly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a valid concern.  OSSL_UNION_ALIGN isn&#8217;t appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise, uintmax_t isn&#8217;t binary compatible.
</I>
I'm glad we agree.

&gt;<i>     If you're thinking that the receiving side should free certain values,
</I>&gt;<i>     then you need to pass a pointer to the routine to be used to free the
</I>&gt;<i>     value rather than just a flag.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, this is a bad idea.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The API isn&#8217;t easy to use at the moment.  It is also error prone as soon as something complex is
</I>&gt;<i> encountered (which we haven&#8217;t yet).
</I>&gt;<i> Shane struggled to figure this out and get it working when trying the KDFs and he is far more
</I>&gt;<i> experienced than most.
</I>
I have had some experience with the MACs...

&gt;<i> I&#8217;ll see if I can get some kind of diff or PR together.
