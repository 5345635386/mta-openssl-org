<PRE>I assume you're talking about the |return_size| indirection here.
I think you will see much more of them as soon as the asymmetric
algorithms start to show up, as they should naturally contain
get_params functionality for the numbers of the key objects.  For the
moment being, we aren't seeing much of that kind of functionality.

Cheers,
Richard

</I>&gt;<i>         Shane&#8217;s major complaints are about the indirection the OSSL_PARAM structure forces &#8213; for
</I>&gt;<i>         integers and return lengths and the necessity of allocating additional memory in parallel
</I>&gt;<i>         with the OSSL_PARAM.
</I>&gt;<i>        
</I>&gt;<i>         The extra indirection was intended to support const arrays of OSSL_PARAM, which turn out
</I>&gt;<i>         to be a rarity because they aren&#8217;t thread safe.  With most OSSL_PARAM structure being
</I>&gt;<i>         dynamically created, the need for the indirection seems redundant.  E.g. could the return
</I>&gt;<i>         length be moved into OSSL_PARAM?  I think so.
</I>&gt;<i>        
</I>&gt;<i>         Moving integral values into the structure is more difficult because BIGNUMs will always
</I>&gt;<i>         need to be references.  Allocating additional memory will still be required.  I&#8217;ve got
</I>&gt;<i>         three obvious solutions:
</I>&gt;<i>        
</I>&gt;<i>         1. include a void * in the OSSL_PARAM structure that needs to be freed when the structure
</I>&gt;<i>         is destroyed or
</I>&gt;<i>         2. have a block of data in the OSSL_PARAM structure that can be used for native types
</I>&gt;<i>         (OSSL_UNION_ALIGN works perfectly for this) or
</I>&gt;<i>         3. add a flag field to the OSSL_PARAM to indicate that the referenced value needs to be
</I>&gt;<i>         freed.
</I>&gt;<i>        
</I>&gt;<i>         The memory allocation comes to the for when reading e.g. a file and extracting data &#8213;
</I>&gt;<i>         either the reader needs a lot of local variables to hold everything or it has to allocated
</I>&gt;<i>         for each.  The file&#8217;s data is transient in memory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         For the most part, the receiver side APIs seem reasonable.  It is the owning side that has
</I>&gt;<i>         the complications.
</I>&gt;<i>        
</I>&gt;<i>         I think I might be able come up with some owner side routines that assist here but
</I>&gt;<i>         allowing changes to the params structure would be far easier.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         I kind of like using the OSSL_PARAM arrays as a replacement for string ctrl functions if
</I>&gt;<i>         not ctrl as well (subject to backward compatibility concerns).

</I>&gt;<i>            
</I>&gt;<i>             Either way, the OSSL_PARAM is defined publically and openly (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i>             non-opaque), and we currently have the following functions in the
</I>&gt;<i>             public API:

</I>&gt;<i>                OSSL_PROVIDER_get_params
</I>&gt;<i>            
</I>&gt;<i>             I fully expect that more will come.  I have a branch where I've
</I>&gt;<i>             EVP_MAC_CTX_set_params, for example, and I wouldn't be surprised if
</I>&gt;<i>             EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_params and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_params appear before
</I>&gt;<i>             long (I'm actually rather surprised they haven't already), and I'm
</I>&gt;<i>             absolutely sure we will see similar functions for asymmetric
</I>&gt;<i>             algorithms.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                 What changed your mind?
</I>&gt;<i>                
</I>&gt;<i>                 Perhaps not surprisingly, I agree with Shane's assessment and am
</I>&gt;<i>                 strongly opposed to the project foisting this on everyone at this
</I>&gt;<i>                 time.  @DavidBen, your thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>             Maybe we're reading differently, I didn't see Shane being opposed to
</I>&gt;<i>             parameter passing in this way per se, just the exact form of the
</I>&gt;<i>             OSSL_PARAM structure, which is different.
