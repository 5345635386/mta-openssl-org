This means, we don't use ERR_R_MALLOC when trying to create an RSA key, for example, but rather a handful of new errors for ERR_R_RSA_CANT_CREATE_D, ...CANT_CREATE_N, etc.  That is a big job, albeit mostly a tedious one.

</I>
So basically, what you're actually saying is that we should add
additional errors up the call stack...  so if some function called
OPENSSL_zalloc(), it should be perfectly OK to raise a
ERR_R_MALLOC_FAILURE, but functions above should *add* things like
WHATEVER_R_KEY_CREATE_FAILURE, etc etc etc, thereby creating that
backtrace that Tim talks about.

A point here is that the application may want to find out if there was
an allocation error -- at which point it might choose to simply bail --
or some other error that prevented the key to be created (insecure
amount of bits, say?) -- at which point it might choose to try and
mitigate.  The question is what's easier for the application, getting
the wanted information as a top error or having to walk to the bottom
of the error stack to figure things out.

Cheers,
Richard
