<PRE>This is conflating concerns between FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3 -- they 
are *very* different and completely distinct.

X25519 is not currently permitted under 140-3 (for which our validation 
is a while away).

It was permitted under 140-2 (which is the only currently validated 
module).&#160; The project has asked our lab for a ruling for the 140-2 
validation.
Once the lab responds, we'll know definitively.&#160; These things take time.

If it is no longer permitted under the 140-2 rules, it will be removed 
in due course (either via policy or technically).
If it is permitted, it will remain.

My understanding (which is obviously not definitive), is that it is 
permitted under 140-2.
I could easily be wrong.&#160; FIPS is fickle.
