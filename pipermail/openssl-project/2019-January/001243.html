No, it means that is how it currently coded. We are discussing a PR to change
how this works so we have the opportunity to make it work differently if we so
wish. However since this is a breaking change I'm of the view that we should be
making the minimal change necessary. IMO that is the change that I have proposed
in PR 8096 and as described in the vote text at the beginning of this thread.

I don't think we should be looking at this as a wholesale redesign of how the
info callback works and its relative merits an disadvantages. Like it or not we
have an info callback, and it does what it does. It is in our API and we cannot
remove it (at least not any time soon - see
<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/web/pull/82">https://github.com/openssl/web/pull/82</A>). We implemented it in a particular way
for TLSv1.3 and if we wanted something else then the time to debate that was
prior to the release of 1.1.1. The *only* reason that this is being discussed
now is because of the specific issue with KeyUpdates. PR8096 fixes that in the
simplest way I could think of.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can actually see a use case for wanting to know if a key update
</I>&gt;<i> has been received and sent. Maybe the application wants to make
</I>&gt;<i> sure that at regular intervals this is done. I just doubt that
</I>&gt;<i> this is the most useful interface for that. The way to do that is
</I>&gt;<i> to tell OpenSSL to do that instead.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Certificate requests are similar, i.e. the server sees the sending of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certificate request as a single standalone exchange, and the receipt of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subsequent Certificate/Finished as a separate exchange. The client sees the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receipt of the request and its response as one single exchange.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the server really only cares that it's been received, and
</I>&gt;<i> you can argue that it should be 1 exchange.
</I>
I'm not entirely sure what you mean by &quot;1 exchange&quot;, but if you mean the sending
of the request and the subsequent receipt of the certificate/finished should be
1 exchange as far as the info callback is concerned then I don't think that
would work. There may be intervening messages and application data transfer.
