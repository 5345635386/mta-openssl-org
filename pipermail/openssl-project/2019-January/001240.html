They are each separate post-handshake exchanges. Both on the server and on the
client.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it important that both sides agree what an &quot;exchange&quot; is?
</I>
The answers all depend on how the OpenSSL state machine views them. At the
moment the peer sending a KeyUpdate sees that as a single standalone exchange.
If an update has been requested then the receiving peer sees the receiving and
subsequent sending of the next KeyUpdate as a single exchange.

Certificate requests are similar, i.e. the server sees the sending of the
certificate request as a single standalone exchange, and the receipt of the
subsequent Certificate/Finished as a separate exchange. The client sees the
receipt of the request and its response as one single exchange.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I'm getting at here is that &quot;post-handshake exchange&quot; does not seem to be a
</I>&gt;<i> meaningful construct to the protocol. I would thus advocate not signaling
</I>&gt;<i> START/END things to begin with. That way, if TLS 1.4 comes by and shuffles
</I>&gt;<i> around again, we don't repeat this adventure.
</I>
If we signal them at all then I think they must be signalled with start/end
since there can be multiple state changes for a single exchange (e.g. when the
client receives a certificate request).
