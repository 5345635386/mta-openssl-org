</I>
Exactly. That is why I am proposing that each time we create a branch it
is associated with a major release ONLY. You can't have two branches
with the same major release because that means you cannot make MINOR
changes on the older branch - even ones that we would historically have
allowed.

</I>&gt;<i> That is not how a semantically versioned project behaves.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The rules are strict for a reason to stop some of the practices that we
</I>&gt;<i> have - where PATCH releases add APIs.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Part of the precondition for a semantically versioned project is that
</I>&gt;<i> the API (and in this sense this is the public API) is under &quot;control&quot; as
</I>&gt;<i> such.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think there are very few circumstances under which we have needed to
</I>&gt;<i> add APIs - and I think outside of accessor functions during the opacity
</I>
Looking through changes we have made to 1.1.0 headers there are more
than just accessor functions:

- Add &quot;const&quot; qualifiers to functions
- Add error function or reason codes
- Not sure what to classify this change
as:<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6874">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6874</A>
- This change modified some public macro values in 1.1.0:
<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6075/files">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6075/files</A>
- This change modified the way declaration warnings are handled in 1.1.0
public headers:
 <A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6688">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6688</A>
- We deprecated a function which was documented as deprecated, should
have been deprecated, but wasn't inside the deprecated guards:
<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6588">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6588</A>
- We added a whole set of functions for creating X509_LOOKUP_METHODS:
<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6152">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6152</A>
- Added some new macros:
<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6037">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6037</A>
- We removed a macro added in a previous &quot;letter&quot; release because we
realised it was a mistake:
<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/5968">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/5968</A>
- Fixed a typo in a macro name:
 <A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/3292">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/3292</A>
- Added a new SSL_OP_NO_ code
<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/4901">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/4901</A>

There's a stack load more changes than this. I stopped looking after a
relatively short time. Probably (almost) all of these would have to be
released as a new MINOR version number under semantic versioning. I
don't see this changing as we move into the future.
