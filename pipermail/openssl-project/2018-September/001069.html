The problem is that we documented a major.minor.fix.patch as our versioning
scheme and semantic versioning is different.
Semantic versioning does not allow for breaking changes on the minor
version - and that is what we do in OpenSSL currently.
Part of the requests that have come in for semantic versioning is to
actually do what is &quot;expected&quot;.

Basically our significant version changes alter the minor version field in
the OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER structure.
And we have loosely referred to those as major releases but not changed the
actual major version field - but the minor.

The simple way to look at this: for OpenSSL-1.0.2a:
- what is the major version number - the answer is clearly &quot;1&quot;.
- what is the minor version number - the answer is clearly &quot;0&quot;
- what is the fix version number - the answer is clear &quot;2&quot;
- what is the patch version number - the answer is clearly &quot;a&quot;

If you repeat that in semantic versioning concepts just using the labels
for mapping you get:
- what is the major version number - the answer is clearly &quot;1&quot;.
- what is the minor version number - the answer is clearly &quot;0&quot;
- what is the fix version number - there is no such thing
- what is the patch version number - the answer is clearly &quot;2&quot; (reusing the
fix version)

If you repeat that in semantic versioning concepts just using the actual
definitions:
- what is the major version number - the answer is clearly &quot;1&quot;.
- what is the minor version number - the answer is probably &quot;2&quot;
- what is the fix version number - there is no such thing
- what is the patch version number - the answer is probably &quot;0&quot;

Semantic versioning does not have the concept of a fix version separate
from a patch version - those are just a fix version.
If you add or deprecate APIs you have a new minor version. If you fix bugs
without touching the API is it a patch version.
If you break anything in the API is a major version.
It is completely totally about the API itself.

And for OpenSSL we are API compatible for most releases - except when we
did the major change for 1.1.0 which in reality semantic versioning would
have called 2.0.0

Semantic versioning does not have the concept of an API and a ABI
distinction.
In OpenSSL we have if the major.minor is the same then we are ABI
compatible. That is what doesn't exist in the semantic versioning approach
- it is about the API.

Effectively the current &quot;minor&quot; version disappears.

Tim.
