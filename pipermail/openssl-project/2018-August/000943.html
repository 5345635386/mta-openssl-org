Ok...no discussion...

I think perhaps a vote is the only way forward then. Does this vote text
seem reasonable?

&quot;We should remove the TLSv1.2 to TLSv1.3 PSK compatibility mechanism as
discussed in issue 6490. If TLSv1.2 PSKs are configured (and not TLSv1.3
PSKs) then we should disable TLSv1.3.&quot;

If the vote fails then we will, by default, stick with the status quo
(which is effectively option 2). If it passes then that is option 1.
