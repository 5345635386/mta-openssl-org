</I>
Octet strings are by *defintion* not wide characters, they are an
opaque string of *octets* (an array of uint8).  The purpose of
whchar_t and friends is to process non-ascii *character strings*,
with the wide versions of strlen(), strchr(), ...  We do none of
this.  We pass the opaque input to a key-derivation function that
treats it as a opaque octet-string.

&gt;<i> We cannot know with absolute certainty that it's UTF-8 encoded.
</I>
Indeed someone could pass us an octet string that is not derived
from the UTF-8 encoding of some actual character string entered
by a user.  That does not matter.  What matters is that all
user input is canonically encoded, in a *platform-independent*
way.  And for that the application is responsible for converting
user input to UTF-8.  If the application does not do it right,
it will get incorrect (fail to decrypt) or non-portable (fail
to decrypt in the future on other platforms) behaviour.


&gt;<i> The way I saw it is that UTF-8
</I>&gt;<i> really means Unicode, and a way to codify that is wchar_t.
</I>
NO.  That's not the point.  UTF-8 yields a canonical encoding
of what the user typed to an opaque octet string.  That
encoding is the application's responsibility.  We must not
treat the password as a character string, that's not portable.

&gt;<i> openssl-users&gt; That is the password is an opaque byte string, not a character
</I>&gt;<i> openssl-users&gt; string in the platform's encoding of i18n strings.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is, unfortunately, where standards differ.  PKCS#12 has a
</I>&gt;<i> requirement that makes the pass phrase anything but opaque.
</I>
OK, looking at:

  <A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7292#appendix-B.1">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7292#appendix-B.1</A>

we see that PKCS#5 v2.1 sensibly defines passwords as opaque strings
in some unspecified standard encoding (ASCII or UTF-8 for example).

PKCS#12 however, is sadly requiring a 16-bit BMPString encoding
(instead of UTF-8), presumably for backwards compatibility.

&gt;<i> With that, the characters have meaning and need to be interpreted
</I>&gt;<i> correctly to form a standard compliant BMPString.
</I>
Well, in that case for PKCS#12 we must require a well-formed
UTF-8 input, which we can convert to BMPString without any
need for locale-specific information.  The ASN.1 library
presumably can convert from UTF-8 to BMP, or code can be
added to do that if missing.

&gt;<i> (it would have been smarter to have the PKCS12 routines take wchar_t
</I>&gt;<i> strings rather than char strings...  hindsight is what it is...)
</I>
No, wchar_t is not defined to be a 16-bit BMPString compatible
encoding.  It is AFAIK a platform-specific string representation
that is not canonical.
