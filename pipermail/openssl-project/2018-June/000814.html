Taking off on a bit of a tangent, how much justification did we go
through when adding pthreads as a dependency.  I have not been
following very much (Kurt would know more), but apparently in Debian
there are some issues regarding (statically linked?) applications
and libraries that use libcrypto but do not explicitly link with
-pthread.  &quot;Issues&quot; here being, IIRC, crashes at runtime.
