I haven't really followed it, I just saw some mentionng of it on
IRC. At least static linkig glibc itself is complicated. I guess
it's also complicated because libc itself contains stubs for the
pthread functions, so at least the order of the libraries will be
important when linking staticly. But I didn't read anything about
crashes, I might have missed things.
