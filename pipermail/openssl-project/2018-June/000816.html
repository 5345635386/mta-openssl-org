<PRE>In message &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-project.html">fe9ed5f1-9f8f-792b-9f26-512af63cec89 at openssl.org</A>&gt; on Thu, 7 Jun 2018 17:55:27 +0200, Andy Polyakov &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-project.html">appro at openssl.org</A>&gt; said:

appro&gt; &gt; Regarding general use of other libraries, please think carefully before voting, 'cause this *is* tricky. If you have a look, you will see that we *currently* depend on certain standard libraries, such as, for example, libdl.
appro&gt; 
appro&gt; One has to recognize that each dependency has to be justified.

Yes, of course.  Caution is advisable, always.

appro&gt; &gt; And perhaps we should also mention the pile of libraries used with windows.
appro&gt; 
appro&gt; It's not about amount, but ubiquity and stability. Windows is bad
appro&gt; example in the context, because it's rather &quot;mono-cultural&quot; environment.

Yes, you're right, and I didn't really mean to make a serious argument
about the amount, just pointing out that we already rely on standard /
system libraries.

appro&gt; But *otherwise* thing is that we already *know* that those extra
appro&gt; libraries work. Or at least know what to expect and how to deal with
appro&gt; them on different platforms. They were effectively proven to work by
appro&gt; lasting through several releases and years-long bug ironing. This *is*
appro&gt; factor too. And that's what made me pose &quot;is b) part of vote&quot; in my last
appro&gt; post.

I'll have you note that the PR that I'm pointing at still has an open
question about how to deal with the problem of some systems not
reliably support iconv.
