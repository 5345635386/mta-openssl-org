<PRE>I see you already started the votes.  No time for discussion?

I think OpenSSL should be a &quot;fundamental&quot; system library.  Perhaps the apps are different, but it should not require new libraries but could use them if available -- either at run-time or via config/build.

I think iconv in particular is a bad thing to require at this time, in a 1.1.1 release.  It's not clear to me that it meets our API/ABI compatibility guarantee.  I also dislike iconv because of its size, the fact that it is a gross collection of hacks -- not its fault, it's the nature of charsets -- and that it is not universal.  This means that apps that &quot;do the right thing&quot; on some platforms, will FAIL to do so on opthers.

It is very very late in the release process to be adding a new dependency.

Finally, I believe that for this particular issue, we can add an API that enables applications to do the right thing, and we can add flags and warnings to the command-line that make it more clear when a user isn't doing the right thing (such as because they have existing files they need to read).

VOTE NO.

    Hi,
    
    This PR has been blocked, forcing a vote:
    
        <A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6392">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6392</A>
    
    Background: we have been sloppy when producing PKCS#12 files, creating
    objects that aren't interoperable.  This can only happen with non-UTF8
    input methods, so this PR adds a higher level of control in the
    openssl application, so that it will do the best it can to make sure a
    pass phrase encoded with something other than UTF-8 gets correctly
    re-encoded, and failing that, try and make the user aware that they
    are about to create a non-interoperable object.  This triggered the
    use of the iconv API, and in the case of Mac OS/X, the use of the
    separate libiconv library.
    
    I'm going to make this into two votes, as both topics have come out
    because of this.
    
    1. A vote about general use of other libraries, limited to standard
       system libraries, which may be platform dependent (I expect
       libiconv on Mac OS/X to be such a library)
    
    2. A vote about the use of the iconv API
    
    Please discuss here, no in the vote threads.
    
    Cheers,
    Richard
