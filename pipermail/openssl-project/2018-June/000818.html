<PRE>In message &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-project.html">dd33adfb-e283-f8fb-26a7-9aeacca60ffe at openssl.org</A>&gt; on Thu, 7 Jun 2018 16:58:20 +0200, Andy Polyakov &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/openssl-project.html">appro at openssl.org</A>&gt; said:

appro&gt; One can argue that iconv was actually standardized, and in such
appro&gt; case it would be appropriate to make it conditional on
appro&gt; _POSIX_VERSION. [Though it doesn't seem to be part of pull
appro&gt; request in question. Why not?] But as far as _POSIX_VERSION
appro&gt; goes, we kind of know that some systems by *default* offer
appro&gt; lower version, presumably in order to facilitate backward
appro&gt; portability.

[about why not: because I was unsure how _POSIX_SOURCE is defined...
having seen too many places where the user (i.e. us) gets to define
that macro to get desired features.  I've read up since, so expect a
change that uses this macro]

appro&gt; So that it would mean that we would have to explicitly rise the
appro&gt; bar in some cases. Which ones? And how high? This brings us to
appro&gt; following question. Is *this* actually right moment to
appro&gt; introduce that kind of *multi-variable* problem? In other words
appro&gt; the problem kind of has two sides: a) principal, to do or not
appro&gt; to do; b) *when* would it be appropriate to start, is minor
appro&gt; release right moment? Is b) part of the vote?

We don't have to answer the question &quot;how high&quot; now.  I'm fully
prepared to have the use of iconv limited to platforms where we know
it's available (for example, we - or well, *I* - know that VMS has the
iconv API in the C RTL, not even any need to link with any extra
library...  and we *know* it's available in glibc since version
2.something).  I'm fully prepared to have to deal with people saying
&quot;hey, we have that too!&quot; and having to edit config targets as we go.
I do not expect any support of iconv to cover more than what we can
test or get patches for, as with anything else.

Cheers,
Richard
