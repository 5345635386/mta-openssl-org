This text does not seem to help me to make a vote, it seems I just
get more questions.

The EVP_PKEY_set_alias_type() manpage says that SM2 use the same
encoding an ECDSA. I assume that during deserialization we don't
know if we should create an ECDSA key or an SM2 key, because we
don't look at the OID when deserializing and always create an
ECDSA key. My understanding is that there is code that needs to
know an SM2 key is stored in that object, and is not looking at
the OID, but instead looks at what the pkey type is. My suggested
fix for that would be to make the deserialization smarter so it
sets the correct pkey type base on the OID.

Assuming that we can get an SM2 key, I currently fail to see why
ECDSA or ECDH wouldn't work with them, but I know very little
about SM2.

I also don't understand what the vote is really about. Can 1.1.1
do SM2 on one of the nist curves?
