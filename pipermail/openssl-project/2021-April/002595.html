<PRE>I do not think we should retriage this. There needs to be just a policy
vote. Depending on the policy vote outcome the PR will have to be
either:
- merged if the policy vote does not pass or passes and the PR does
  not conflict with it
- dropped if the policy vote passes and says that we do not want any
information on blinding in form of a property
- adjusted and merged if the policy vote passes and says that we want
some information on blinding in form of a property but it needs to be
done differently (such as having no-blinding property or whatever)

The policy vote should happen before beta1. The eventual rework should
not take much time so I do not worry about that.

Implicitly, if the vote passes and says we do not want blinding
property in any form, the original issue as triaged by OTC will be
closed. There is no need for extra decision making process on that.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I think this vote tries to cover too much ground in a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; vote. I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; would prefer to see a simple vote of &quot;Do not merge PR#14759&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; *possibly* 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; followed up by separate votes on what our own policies should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; provider implementations, and what we should or should not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; encourage
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 3rd 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; parties to do.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I disagree partially. IMO we should primarily have a policy vote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the closing or merging of PR#14759 should come out of it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; naturally.

No matter how far down the wrong road you've gone, turn back.
