That we need to do what?

It's not because we don't have a requirement that it can be
validated, that we should only implement it half. There are
reasons for those requirements, and they are valid even if you
don't validate it.

There are things we will not be able to do by default, because the
OS does not provide what is needed. But I think there is at least
enough code in there that you can write something so that the DRBG
can be validated.

I'm not sure what you're talking about with the last 2 items. What
changes are you talking about?

What I think might come more as something that breaks things is
that we now periodically reseed. It's not good enough anymore to
have /dev/urandom available at the start and before you chroot, it
now also needs to be available after you chroot. Our use of
getrandom() when available avoids this a little. But glibc in
Debian stable is only at glibc 2.24 while 2.25 is needed. I think
we should consider having support for the syscall ourself. We
should probably also add support for such functions on *BSD.
