Yes, supporting another operating system has a cost!
At risk of drawing Richard's ire, if we did not intend to support
(e.g.) VMS, we might have been able to get away with not writing our
own custom build system in favor of some &quot;industry standard&quot;.
Supporting non-POSIX systems (e.g., Windows) also adds overhead in
how we implement many of our interfaces (file handling, thread
handling, locking, randomness, etc.).

I personally prefer a more conservative/restrictive approach than
the historical trend, and probably also more conservative than the
average of the team.  This is presumably shaped by my personal
experiences and career trajectory, and I understand that others'
path are different and so they will have different, but still valid,
preferences.  We as a team are charged with weighing the tradeoff of
supporting an additional platform against the burden of supporting
it and the risks against our ability to continue supporting it.  For
example, in this modern world where properly supporting a platform
basically does require some assembly code, for crypto-relevant
timing considerations, if only one person understands and will
support that assembly code, that is a risk.  Perhaps it's enough of
a risk to make officially supporting that platform a bad idea;
perhaps not -- it's just one factor that we must, as a whole, weigh
and consider.
Removing platform-specific assembly when not needed for security
would seem to reduce the risk, and presumably improve the
maintainability of the software as a whole.  But I don't see a good
way to not have these decisions all be made on a case-by-case basis.
