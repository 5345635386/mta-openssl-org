NIST SP800-90A rev1 section 8.6.7 has:

</I>|<i> certain attacks. The nonce shall be either:

</I>|<i>
</I>|<i> Each nonce shall be unique to the cryptographic module in which

</I>|<i>

</I>|<i> the date but not the time of day, so a sequence number is appended
</I>|<i> that will not repeat during a particular day.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i> For case 1 above, the random value could be acquired from the same

</I>
Case 1 requires an approved random bit generator, which we don't
have by default.

Case 2 requires the timestamp to be trusted. I think that applies
to case 4 too. This is also something we can't do by default.

I think case 3 requires us keep a counter even after restarting
the application, which seems unlikely that we will implement it.

So by default we can't do any of them. But you can argue that we
can do case 1, 2 and 4 close enough. Case 1 is what we do now.

I think we can do case 2 with something like gettimeofday() or
clock_gettime() which I think provide plenty of resolution
that it's unlikely to repeat.

You can combine that with a counter to get case 4 if you really
wanted.

All you have to do is implement a get_nonce() function and set it
by default. You can keep the behaviour that if no get_nonce function
is set that it increases the entropy requirement.
