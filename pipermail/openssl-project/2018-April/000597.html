<PRE>Where we are stating that ABI compatibility is in place we should be
testing it.
i.e. the older release binaries should be run against the current release
libraries - and that should be put into CI in my view.

Going the other direction isn't something I have thought we have ever
guaranteed (i.e. downgrading) - but programs that don't use new APIs (i.e.
for the ABI) should also work - that is pretty much the definition of an
ABI.
If we are unable to provide the forward ABI then we need to change the
version number of the release going forward. If weare unable to provide
backwards ABI then we need to think about how we are defining things and
make that clear.

And we need to be clear about what we mean by ABI - I don't think we have
written down a clear definition - and then have in CI the tests to match
what we are saying we do.

When it comes to TLSv1.3 it is highly desirable that an existing 1.1.0
application gets TLSv1.3 without API changes - i.e. ABI provides this.
There will be some things where there are problems where assumptions are
invalidated - but we should work to minimise those (and I think we have
actually done so).
But again we should be testing this in CI - if we want old apps to all get
TLSv1.3 for zero effort (other than a shared library upgrade) then we
should test that in CI. Hoping it works or assuming it works and &quot;manually&quot;
watching for changes that might invalidate that is rather error prone.

What Richard is doing really helps add to the information for informed
decisions ... the more information we have the better in my view.

Tim.
