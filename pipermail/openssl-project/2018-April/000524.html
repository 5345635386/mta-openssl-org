kurt&gt; &gt; &gt; get an idea? You would need to sample 1 variable and feed that into
kurt&gt; &gt; &gt; it.
kurt&gt; &gt; 
kurt&gt; &gt; And yeah, sure, especially if all it takes is to produce a stream of
kurt&gt; &gt; bits from a source and feed that to the assessment program.  As long
kurt&gt; &gt; as I don't have to port a C++11 program to VMS, 'cause unfortunately,
kurt&gt; &gt; the existing C++ compiler hasn't had a real update for quite a while
kurt&gt; &gt; :-/ (I'm sure that VSI is quite busy updating all they can, but they
kurt&gt; &gt; haven't let anything out yet)
kurt&gt; 
kurt&gt; You only need to generate the bits on VMS, you can run the tool on
kurt&gt; some other machine.

Cool.

kurt&gt; If you have such a program that collects the bits, I would like
kurt&gt; to review it. I would also like to test something like that over
kurt&gt; a range of machines it's expected to run on.

Errrrrrr....  I have no idea what you're talking about.  I know of no
other operating system that provides the system services VMS does, so
I wonder how you expect to run the program gathering those data on
anything other than VMS.

If you wanna know what I'm talking about, just have a look at this
page:

<A HREF="http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/doc/84final/4527/4527pro_contents.html">http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/doc/84final/4527/4527pro_contents.html</A>

Every &quot;command&quot; that starts with a '$' is a system service.  The C API
has them prefixed with 'sys$'.  The one of hightes interest seems to
be $GETRMI (or sys$getrmi), which has all sorts of counters and other
data.

kurt&gt; I wonder if it's useful to have a thread of VMS that collects
kurt&gt; such bits all the time, like the kernel is doing.

I was pondering something like that, and it does make sense.  That, or
creating a generic device driver (RND0:) that works a bit like the
random driver on Linux, or perhaps the one from OpenBSD...

kurt&gt; I'm going to guess that the 4 bit you count now is an overestimate.

Don't look at me, it was I who made that estimate...  but I agree with
your guess.

kurt&gt; And I would like to be very conservative in estimating something
kurt&gt; like that, and even divide what the tool returns by 10.

That's a reason I want to go for a computed estimate instead...  the
3rd order delta that Linux' random driver does with jiffies seemed
like a simple enough strategy.

Cheers,
Richard
