It's right there in the quoted text, it needs to be signed.

But I wonder how that it supposed to really work. If you want to
avoid a replay attack, does that mean you need to use a nonce? Do
we bootstrap problem?

&gt;<i> kurt&gt; I think case 3 requires us keep a counter even after restarting
</I>&gt;<i> kurt&gt; the application, which seems unlikely that we will implement it.
</I>&gt;<i> kurt&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> kurt&gt; So by default we can't do any of them. But you can argue that we
</I>&gt;<i> kurt&gt; can do case 1, 2 and 4 close enough. Case 1 is what we do now.

</I>&gt;<i> Hmmmm...  case 4 shouldn't pose too much problems unless you restart

</I>&gt;<i> hardware (a VAX is decidedly not in that range, Alpha has a minimum
</I>&gt;<i> update rate of 1ms, Itaniums are faster than most Alphas...).  Either
</I>&gt;<i> way, the timestamp is 64 bits, it seems that then, we'd add a 64-bit
</I>&gt;<i> counter to match the 128 bit nonce requirement, do I get that right?
</I>
What is not clear to me is that all DRBGs (the 1+2N) need to have
a unique nonce or not. The 3 first are all most likely to be
instantiated very close to each other. It might be that the
requirement is the nonce for all 3 is different. If you combine
this with a counter (case 4), it's easy to do this on a per
process basis, even if the time is only updated once per second.

But maybe the requirement can be over multiple processes? I really
don't know enough about this.

&gt;<i> kurt&gt; I think we can do case 2 with something like gettimeofday() or
</I>&gt;<i> kurt&gt; clock_gettime() which I think provide plenty of resolution
</I>&gt;<i> kurt&gt; that it's unlikely to repeat.
</I>&gt;<i> kurt&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> kurt&gt; You can combine that with a counter to get case 4 if you really
</I>&gt;<i> kurt&gt; wanted.
</I>&gt;<i> kurt&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> kurt&gt; All you have to do is implement a get_nonce() function and set
</I>&gt;<i> kurt&gt; it by default. You can keep the behaviour that if no get_nonce
</I>&gt;<i> kurt&gt; function is set that it increases the entropy requirement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Aha ok!  Yeahok, I see, so if I implement a rand_drbg_get_nonce in
</I>&gt;<i> rand_vms.c, we're basically set...  but that means we need to
</I>&gt;<i> implement a generic one as well, no?
</I>
It might be a little strange that the default is different on
different platforms, but I don't see why that should be a problem.
But having a generic one is probably more useful to a VMS specific
one.
