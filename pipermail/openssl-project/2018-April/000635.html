<PRE>Google incurs a significant, ongoing cost to support clients that don't
send SNI. Such clients, at least in the HTTP space, are easy to miss in
casual testing (because browsers do send SNI), and require that we ensure
that a given name is covered by the default certificates on any IP address
that could be served for that name.

However, since not sending SNI generally works for Google services, we not
only have a legacy of clients that could send SNI but don't, but a stream
of new clients that ship without noticing the problem. In short, the
problem is not getting any better.

Rather than break existing clients, with TLS 1.3 we are trying a more
incremental approach: if a client is new enough to support TLS 1.3 then
either it should be sending SNI, or we'll give it a dummy certificate. If
the client didn't send SNI because it doesn't have a hostname to verify
against anyway, then the dummy certificate works just as well. If it does
have a hostname to verify against, then it should send that in SNI.

This only affects the choice of certificate, not the protocol version. To
the downgrade question, that is just, as Kurt suggested, the usual
temporary draft version mismatch and unrelated. The certificate behavior is
triggered by supported_versions in the ClientHello, which is why you're
still seeing it on draft mismatch.

That won't solve clients that aren't updating, but it might at least give
us a negative gradient. We expect this experience with SNI is shared with
other large TLS deployments and hope that the ecosystem effects will
therefore be generally valuable.

The above was done with HTTP in mind, but the code also triggers for SMTP
as you have observed. SMTP is complicated by the fact that it's not so
clear which hostname to verify against: ideally one would match the domain
part of the email address, but in practice we know that doesn't work very
well and that, in many cases, one will trust the MX lookup and verify the
MX name instead.

So, if doing certificate verification, we believe that the logic above
applies and that an MTA should be sending an SNI value equal to what name
they will be validating against. (Or, if you'll accept either, pick
one&#8212;probably the MX name.)

If the MTA is not validating certificates, then not sending SNI is fine and
the invalid2.invalid certificate works because it's not being validated
anyway.

Having said that, this was intended more for HTTP-based clients. Our Gmail
team are aware of this and may choose not to apply this behaviour to SMTP
clients in the future.
