You only need to generate the bits on VMS, you can run the tool on
some other machine.

If you have such a program that collects the bits, I would like to
review it. I would also like to test something like that over a
range of machines it's expected to run on.

I wonder if it's useful to have a thread of VMS that collects such
bits all the time, like the kernel is doing.

I'm going to guess that the 4 bit you count now is an overestimate.
And I would like to be very conservative in estimating something
like that, and even divide what the tool returns by 10.
