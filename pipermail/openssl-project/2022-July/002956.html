OpenSSL Security Advisory [5 July 2022]
=======================================

Heap memory corruption with RSA private key operation (CVE-2022-2274)
=====================================================================

Severity: High

The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA
implementation for X86_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions.
This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys
incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during
the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker
may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine performing
the computation.

SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running
on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64 architecture
are affected by this issue.

Note that on a vulnerable machine, proper testing of OpenSSL would fail and
should be noticed before deployment.

Users of the OpenSSL 3.0.4 version should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.5.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue.

This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 22nd June 2022 by Xi Ruoyao. The
fix was developed by Xi Ruoyao.

over time.

AES OCB fails to encrypt some bytes (CVE-2022-2097)
===================================================

Severity: MODERATE

AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised
implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some
circumstances.  This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was
preexisting in the memory that wasn't written.  In the special case of
&quot;in place&quot; encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed.

Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS,
they are both unaffected.

This issue affects versions 1.1.1 and 3.0.  It was addressed in the
releases of 1.1.1q and 3.0.5 on the 5th July 2022.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 users should upgrade to 1.1.1q
OpenSSL 3.0 users should upgrade to 3.0.5

This issue was reported to OpenSSL on the 15th June 2022 by Alex
Chernyakhovsky from Google. The fix was developed by Alex Chernyakhovsky,
David Benjamin and Alejandro Sede&#241;o from Google.
