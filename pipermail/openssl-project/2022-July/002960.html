<PRE>Just moving things around in the source tree does not achieve much so
without the actual splitting the functionality out of the libcrypto
does not make sense to me. Maybe it could be seen as a preparation step
for the split out.

However yes, it was a misunderstanding IMO that we would want to split
it completely out of the main OpenSSL project tree. I do not think this
is necessary or even desirable.

However as many applications do not need this functionality it would be
useful to have it as a separate shared library so loading libcrypto is
less expensive. Still I think this is a 4.0 project.

</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* applications that also require the more high-level capabilities

</I>&gt;<i> We may also consider splitting the existing libcrypto just virtually,
</I>&gt;<i> e.g., into two code directories (say, crypto/ and crypto/apps/, which
</I>&gt;<i> includes CMS, CMP, OCSP, HTTP, TS, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;plus an actual library (say, libapps) that is more application-level

</I>&gt;<i> &#160;This likely would provide a better pros/cons ratio than actually

</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is something we could look at tackling in a future major

</I>&gt;<i> &#160;With just re-arranging the code into three (or more, rather than so
</I>&gt;<i> far two) OpenSSL libraries, there will be no issue with capability

</I>&gt;<i> &#160;In particular, as Tomas wrote, the openssl app will continue to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &#160;In a sense it is an instance of a more general suggestion I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; gave
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &#160;* back in 2017:&#160; Introducing an application-level library for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; the CLI and OpenSSL-based applications #4992 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &#160;* and in 2020:&#160; Improve overall OpenSSL library structure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; #13440 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; which pertains also to CMS, HTTP, OCSP, TS, and maybe further
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; more application-level component(s) of libcrypto like CT.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; The CMP implementation does not rely on libssl, but it does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; heavily rely on libcrypto and relies on some of its internals.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &#160;The same holds for HTTP, and likely this also holds for CMS,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; OCSP, TS, and CT.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It looks like CMP heavily relies on libcrypto/libssl, but

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seemed a good rationale both to me and to the OpenSSL team
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to separate a GOST engine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It looks like there was some discussion in

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how far the conversation of in-OpenSSL vs standalond project
