<PRE>So one of the ways to handle a transition that I've thought about a number
of times would be the following.

1) We split things out into multiple separate libraries.
2) We keep a combined library around using the current names which has all
the split libraries joined together.

So people who want to move to using just the parts they want to work with
can transition, and people who have fixed usage based on current practice
of the last 20 years keep working.

Then we could have the different TLS protocols split out, split out cmp,
split out smime, split out ocsp, etc - all of these items into separate
libraries - but also not break all the packaging usage of all existing
applications.

In terms of git sub projects - we could also look at that side of things
too - and if we combine the source release from multiple sub-projects into
one for packaging purpose we would again have a path to allow us to change
things around without having a significant impact on the packages that use
openssl already.

These are just some thoughts about ways to move from where we are at the
moment without causing unnecessary breakage elsewhere.
I still think this isn't something to do until the next major version -
i.e. openssl 4.0

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I fully agree.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To avoid any misunderstandings on what I wrote before:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  My proposal (possibly in difference to Dmitry's) was and still is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not to move any functionality out of the OpenSSL main repository,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  but to re-arrange the library structure (likely by splitting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; libcrypto into two or more libraries) to better reflect the code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; layering.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Expected benefits:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * improve clarity of the software component structure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * slightly alleviate development and maintenance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * reduce binary code footprint in case just the crypto core or just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TLS (including crypto) is needed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Expected drawbacks:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * any re-structuring requires more or less work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * some so far internal crypto interfaces that are used by the more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application-level code need to be exported
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * applications that also require the more high-level capabilities
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will need to link with more libraries
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We may also consider splitting the existing libcrypto just virtually,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; e.g., into two code directories (say, crypto/ and crypto/apps/, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; includes CMS, CMP, OCSP, HTTP, TS, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  plus an actual library (say, libapps) that is more application-level
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and includes everything that requires both TLS any crypto features,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; such as HTTPS and part of (or even all of) apps/lib/.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  This likely would provide a better pros/cons ratio than actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; splitting up libcrypto.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This is something we could look at tackling in a future major
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; release - but even then it faces challenges to be workable for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; desired outcome (broad distribution of capability).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  With just re-arranging the code into three (or more, rather than so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; far two) OpenSSL libraries, there will be no issue with capability
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because nothing is lost for OpenSSL users.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  In particular, as Tomas wrote, the openssl app will continue to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provide everything that it did before.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thanks Dmitry for sharing this thought.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  In a sense it is an instance of a more general suggestion I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gave
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  * back in 2017:  Introducing an application-level library for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the CLI and OpenSSL-based applications #4992
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  * and in 2020:  Improve overall OpenSSL library structure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #13440
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which pertains also to CMS, HTTP, OCSP, TS, and maybe further
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more application-level component(s) of libcrypto like CT.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The CMP implementation does not rely on libssl, but it does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heavily rely on libcrypto and relies on some of its internals.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  The same holds for HTTP, and likely this also holds for CMS,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OCSP, TS, and CT.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It looks like CMP heavily relies on libcrypto/libssl, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure it requires an integration - and, last but not

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to separate a GOST engine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It looks like there was some discussion in
