I fully agree.

To avoid any misunderstandings on what I wrote before:
My proposal (possibly in difference to Dmitry's) was and still is *not* 
to move any functionality out of the OpenSSL main repository,
but to re-arrange the library structure (likely by splitting libcrypto 
into two or more libraries) to better reflect the code layering.

Expected benefits:

  * improve clarity of the software component structure
  * slightly alleviate development and maintenance
  * reduce binary code footprint in case just the crypto core or just
    TLS (including crypto) is needed

Expected drawbacks:

  * any re-structuring requires more or less work
  * some so far internal crypto interfaces that are used by the more
    application-level code need to be exported
  * applications that also require the more high-level capabilities will
    need to link with more libraries

We may also consider splitting the existing libcrypto just virtually, 
e.g., into two code directories (say, crypto/ and crypto/apps/, which 
includes CMS, CMP, OCSP, HTTP, TS, etc.)
plus an actual library (say, libapps) that is more application-level and 
includes everything that requires both TLS any crypto features, such as 
HTTPS and part of (or even all of) apps/lib/.
This likely would provide a better pros/cons ratio than actually 
splitting up libcrypto.

&gt;<i> This is something we could look at tackling in a future major release 
</I>&gt;<i> - but even then it faces challenges to be workable for the desired 
</I>&gt;<i> outcome (broad distribution of capability).
</I>With just re-arranging the code into three (or more, rather than so far 
two) OpenSSL libraries, there will be no issue with capability because 
nothing is lost for OpenSSL users.
In particular, as Tomas wrote, the openssl app will continue to provide 
everything that it did before.
