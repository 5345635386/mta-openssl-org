<PRE>The locks aren&#8217;t being held for long.

I have noticed that the lock in the OPENSSL_CTX only seems to be locked for reading and only in one place.  crypto/context.c in openssl_ctx_get_data().  Writes seem to go via CRYPTO_alloc_ex_data() which uses a global write lock (on a different lock).  Would it be feasible to drop the OPENSSL_CTX lock completely?  This would address the issue.  Matt?  I think you know this code the best.

CRYPTO_alloc_ex_data() is calling the new_func pointer under the read lock and the new function can in turn cause a search of the providers for implementations which grabs the provider lock.  Conversely, searching the providers for implementations grabs the provider lock and can lead to openssl_ctx_get_data() grabbing the context lock.

We don&#8217;t appear to have recursion at the moment, but the setup seems a little fragile.  We do have two different ordering for grabbing locks which is also bad.
