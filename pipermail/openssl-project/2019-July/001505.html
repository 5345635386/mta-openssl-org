    1.  DSA is not supported in TLS 1.3.
    2.  DSA is almost never used with TLS 1.2, the public
	CAs and the vast majority of users employ RSA.
    3.  Historical DSA was limited to 1024-bit keys and SHA-1.
	IIRC we now support stronger combinations, but these
	are not widely used.
    4.  As mentioned key disclosure is more likely than with RSA.
    5.  Attack-surface reduction.  If DSA is almost never used,
	why enable it by default?

I might note that I don't count myself amont the &quot;crypto maximalists&quot;
And I'm generally of the &quot;raise the ceiling not the floor&quot; mindset,
RFC7435 and all that.  However, once an algorithm is sufficiently
disused (raising the ceiling worked, and everybody we care about
has moved on) it is then time to turn out the lights.

So what are the reasons for *keeping* DSA enabled by *default*
(at runtime)?  Compile-time still delivers the legacy module,
and the configuration file can enable it with no recompilation.
