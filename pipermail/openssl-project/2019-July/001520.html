<PRE>Bringing the discussions over to the project list.

The problem is initially mentioned in #9454.  Followup issues with infinite recursion and use after free also get mentioned in #9455.  These are addressed by #9477 which clears the flush flag before flushing and removes the dependence on the RAND call.  Reproduction seems to require gcc-8, gcc-7 doesn&#8217;t have the appropriate thread sanitisation.

Overly simplified, the problem boils down to the CTR DRBG needing an AES CTR cipher context to work.  When creating the former, a recursive call is made to get the latter.  A deadlock results due to a cycle in the locking.  The RAND/DRBG code will not be the only place where this occurs.  KDF, MAC and some public key operations will suffer a similar issue.

This is almost certainly going to hurt moving forward.


On to possible mitigations:

1. Make our locks recursive.  Add a reference counter and a thread ID to the lock structure.  There would be no need to make either use atomic operations.  Getting a read lock after a write lock would be considered an extra write lock, handing a write lock while holding a read lock could be problematic.  This seems very messy.

2. Return dependent algorithms as part of the registration process.  The particular algorithm could be preloaded somehow.  I&#8217;m not sure how ugly this will become but it will need names (nids) for each possible DRBG type.



Thoughts anyone?
Any better solutions?
Any other solutions?
