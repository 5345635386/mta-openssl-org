Basically no application that would like to work with algo from legacy
provider and that always needs it to work properly - let's say for
example something that needs to connect legacy Windows shares which use
MD4 to compute some password hash - that application cannot depend on
having the legacy enabled in the openssl config file. It should
explicitly load the legacy provider.

&gt;<i> Regardless of where this discussion gets us, it has always been the

</I>
Sure. What I'm just saying is that having it configurable does not
always mean it can be depended on.

I can see for example an application that works with various hashes and
by default uses secure ones and you as user need the app to check some
old file with old MD4 or RIPEMD160 hash as an exception - this can be
done by the user enabling the legacy provider in the openssl config
file.

No matter how far down the wrong road you've gone, turn back.
