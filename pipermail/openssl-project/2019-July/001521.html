 &gt; Bringing the discussions over to the project list.

That's a very good idea Pauli to bring this subject to a wider audience for discussion.
I would like to take the opportunity to re-post&#160; a general remark which I made in
<A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/9455#issuecomment-515340391">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/9455#issuecomment-515340391</A>

 &gt; I am convinced that issues #9454 and #9455 might be only the tip of an iceberg
 &gt; and we shouldn't just narrow down our focus and fix them as isolated issues.
 &gt; Instead, the @openssl/omc should take them as an indication that it might be
 &gt; necessary to pause and rethink the rules for how and when the low level core
 &gt; routines are allowed to utilize higer level crypto routines (like RAND_bytes()).
 &gt; Also, locking rules might be necessary to prevent lock-order inversion (#9454 (comment)).
 &gt; Or it might be necessary to simplify the design, e.g. by replacing the context lock
 &gt; and the store lock by a single lock.
 &gt;
 &gt; There has been a lot of replumbing going on recently and we need to take care that
 &gt; the overall structure of OpenSSL remains stable and manageable. The double and
 &gt; recursive lock issues are an indicator that things have become more complicated
 &gt; &quot;under the hood&quot; (or should I say more appropriately &quot;under the washing stand&quot;?)
 &gt; The original OpenSSL 3.0.0 Design document is only a snapshot from the very beginning.
 &gt; It has not changed recently, and it might be a good time now to explitly write down
 &gt; all the changes and innovations which have taken place since then.
