I think the reasoning behind having the legacy provider was as a first step to
doing just that, i.e. we move the legacy stuff to a legacy provider and then at
some later point we could choose to separate out the legacy provider as a
separate thing which we don't release with mainline OpenSSL - but if people want
to add it back in then they download and build the legacy provider separately
and just drop it back in and it automatically becomes available again.
