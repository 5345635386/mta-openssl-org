This might be fine for a special build of openssl included within an
application. But what would you recommend for a distribution wide
openssl?

If the legacy provider is not supposed to be loaded for normal
applications then the system-wide configuration file must not load the
provider. And then you have the special legacy apps that need it and so
they need to explicitly load the legacy provider. So saying this is
&quot;just recompliation and configuration change&quot; is at least somewhat
oversimplified.

But I am OK with that. I'm just saying it should be better advertised
and that internally openssl should not use the &quot;load legacy provider by
having it in default config file&quot; to actively encourage the &quot;load
legacy provider only if you *really* need it&quot; behavior.
