The current plan is that if no provider is loaded by the time the first &quot;fetch&quot;
is done, then then &quot;default&quot; provider gets loaded automatically. In other words
the &quot;legacy&quot; provider won't get loaded automatically *unless* it is loaded by
the default configuration file.

I don't recall any discussion about what will be in the default configuration
file. My assumption has always been that the legacy provider would not be
automatically loaded.

&gt;<i>

</I>
The algorithms planned to be moved to the legacy provider are:

Blowfish
CAST
DES (but not 3DES)
DSA
IDEA
MD2
MD4
MDC2
RC2
RC4
RC5
RIPEMD160
SEED
Whirlpool

This is documented in the &quot;Legacy Provider Module&quot; section of the Design Document:

<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/docs/OpenSSL300Design.html">https://www.openssl.org/docs/OpenSSL300Design.html</A>

Note the following caveat that document has about the above list:

&quot;this is not meant to be an exhaustive list, even though fairly complete for the
moment&quot;

&gt;<i>

</I>
My guess is that the ones likely to give us the most problems would be DES, DSA
and RC4

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
IMO this is a major release and therefore we should be taking the opportunity to
encourage applications to move away from these legacy algorithms. That's kind of
the point of having a legacy provider in the first place. Most applications
should not need to use these legacy algos so in my mind it is a sensible default
to not have them available. Only if you *really* need them should you load the
legacy provider.
