To add a bit of anecdata, Debian and Fedora are removing DES support from
(MIT) krb5.  So far all we've seen as bug reports are that the kernel may
still have that enctype in its list to use for NFS (as well as other,
still-useful, ones), and so we need to ignore it instead of bailing.
But given that it provides only ca. $20 of protection, it's not especially
surprising that we aren't seeing much using it.

On the other hand, krb5 is not going around and disabling RC4, even though
RFC 8429 is a thing.
