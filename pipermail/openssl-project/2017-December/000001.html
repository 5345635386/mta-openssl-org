<PRE>Almost completely correct in my view - except that the list of what can be
discussed on openssl-omc is an expected/suggested/anticipated list of
topics. It is not a prohibition on other topics. But it is very much the
intent to have things as open and as transparent as possible.

I do expect this will take some adjustment and we will be asking ourselves
and each other whether or not anything going to the OMC list should instead
be moved to openssl-project.

Tim.

</I>&gt;<i>     privileges and anyone can subscribe as reader. Discussions and
</I>&gt;<i>     appropriate vote proposals should be on this list. Note that the
</I>&gt;<i>     openssl-omc list should be used for: releases, financials,
</I>&gt;<i>     security (and releases), legal issues, and membership discussions,
</I>&gt;<i>     and personnel issues (like vacation) and all actual voting as
</I>&gt;<i>     well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This votes was passed with seven +1's and one -1, no abstentions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the details are still discussed, and may very well lead to
</I>&gt;<i> other votes which changes some of the details, or a more precise
</I>&gt;<i> policy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The intent with this list has already been discussed, but I will recap
</I>&gt;<i> here.  Our intent is for more transparency, making our governance more
</I>&gt;<i> visible to all our team members (OMC and committers alike), and also
</I>&gt;<i> to the general public.  For all intents and purposes, discussions
</I>&gt;<i> about the project that isn't about development per se should go on
</I>&gt;<i> this list primarily.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The OMC reserves the right and may choose to have certain discussions
</I>&gt;<i> on the OMC specific list.  That is what the note about what
</I>&gt;<i> openssl-omc in the vote is about.  That note is restrictive, i.e. the
</I>&gt;<i> OMC *may* *NOT* discuss things that aren't mentioned in that note on
</I>&gt;<i> openssl-omc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that actual OMC voting, at least as off now, will happen on
</I>&gt;<i> openssl-omc.  The vote text as well as the result will be presented
</I>&gt;<i> here, however, in much the same way as I presented the vote of this
</I>&gt;<i> list above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [If I got something wrong, please correct me]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
