matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 1.1.1 Release timetable proposal
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; ================================
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; With all of the above in mind here is my straw man proposal for 1.1.1:
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 23rd January 2018, alpha release 1 (pre1)
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 20th February 2018, alpha release 2 (pre2)
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 	OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable created (feature freeze)
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 	master becomes basis for 1.1.2 or 1.2.0 (TBD)
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 20th March 2018, beta release 1 (pre3)
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 17th April 2018, 1.1.1 public release (assuming TLSv1.3 RFC is published)
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; An alpha release means:
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; - Not (necessarily) feature complete
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; - Not necessarily all new APIs in place yet
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; A beta release means:
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; - Feature complete/Feature freeze
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; - Bug fixes only
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; Note that alpha release 2 may have new features in it, but we will
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; freeze at that point so that beta release 1 will not have new features.
matt&gt; &gt; 
matt&gt; &gt; That is perfectly contradictory.  You write it yourself, and alpha
matt&gt; &gt; release means &quot;Not (necessarely) feature complete&quot;, but if you do a
matt&gt; &gt; feature freeze with alpha 2, then there's no space to complete the
matt&gt; &gt; features that may remain.  So in practice, you're making alpha 2 a
matt&gt; &gt; beta.  I am *strictly* opposed to this confusing message.
matt&gt; 
matt&gt; Your way seems even more confusing (to me).
matt&gt; 
matt&gt; Looking at this from a user's perspective, if we say that a beta release
matt&gt; has no new features and only contains bug fixes, then this implies
matt&gt; &quot;since the last release&quot;. Therefore the logical conclusion is that beta
matt&gt; rules apply from the beginning of the development phase for that
matt&gt; release. The development phase for the beta release starts as soon as
matt&gt; the last alpha is done. Therefore the feature freeze should apply from
matt&gt; that point.

I disagree with your interpretation.  Mine is that going into beta
means &quot;From this point on, there will be no more added features&quot;,
which is essentially what a feature freeze means, and that is also
what people usually mean.

Ref: <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle</A>

Note that in that article, they say this about the Alpha phase:  &quot;The
alpha phase usually ends with a feature freeze, indicating that no
more features will be added to the software.&quot;

The last alpha release doesn't mark the end of an alpha phase, the
first beta does.

&quot;Beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but
likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs.&quot;

This is what people expect when you say alpha and beta, and this is
how we have behaved before.  Why we should act differently now is a
mystery to me...  or well, I can see that there's a desire to rush
things because of the anticipated publication of TLS 1.3.  However, I
think it's the wrong move, and even more so by blurring the usual
meaning of alpha and beta.

matt&gt; &gt; 
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; I think compressing the release cadence to less than 4 weeks (which is
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; implied by your suggestion) is overly ambitious and could be setting
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; ourselves up to fail. If you want to bring the final release date
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; earlier then one possibility is to drop the second alpha release, so the
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; timetable becomes:
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 23rd January 2018, alpha release 1 (pre1)
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 	OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable created (feature freeze)
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 	master becomes basis for 1.1.2 or 1.2.0 (TBD)
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 20th February 2018, beta release 1 (pre2)
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 20th March 2018, 1.1.1 public release (assuming TLSv1.3 RFC is published)
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; 
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; Doing it that way still gives us the best part of 2 months to work on
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; the release criteria (i.e. closing off old issues). Another option is to
matt&gt; &gt; matt&gt; relax the release criteria, so we need less time to work on them.
matt&gt; &gt; 
matt&gt; &gt; And with this, you're proposing that our release cycle starts with a
matt&gt; &gt; beta in practice, no matter what you call it.  I am *brutally* opposed
matt&gt; &gt; to this plan.
matt&gt; &gt; 
matt&gt; 
matt&gt; Well, I am not enthused by this version of the plan either. It was only
matt&gt; put forward as a possible way of achieving Rich's desire for a March
matt&gt; public release. I think my initial plan version with the extra alpha
matt&gt; release is better. I've not yet heard a justification for why we should
matt&gt; be targeting March. If it's to line up with the earliest reasonable date
matt&gt; that we expect the TLS1.3 RFC to be published then that doesn't seem
matt&gt; like a good enough reason to me.

Thank you, we seem to agree.

Cheers,
Richard
