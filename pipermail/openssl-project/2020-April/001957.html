<PRE>That we do not run CI explicitly before such cherry picks does not mean
that there is no CI run at all. The CI is triggered when the cherry-
picked commit is merged. If we were checking the status of the 1.1.1
branch CI runs periodically (with a bot sending e-mails about failures
to openssl-project or another list perhaps?). We could then quickly fix
it if cherry-pick introduced a regression.

I also see only a single case where a cherry pick introduced regression
on the 1.1.1 branch during the April. So I do not think we have a
serious issue requiring the mandatory process change immediately.
On the other hand I have no hard problems with the Matthias' proposal
either.

Also perhaps we should just make a recommendation on which kind of
commits (although cherry-picking cleanly) should have a separate PR.
For example commits touching crypto implementations and the EVP layer
should have separate 1.1.1 PRs even though they cherry-pick cleanly. 

And of course there is no requirement to not do the cherry-pick PR even
if the cherry-pick is clean. It is up to the committer discretion to
decide whether it is needed or not.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: Cherry-pick proposal
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I can agree it is a good idea to always require backport as a
</I>&gt;<i> separate PR, with the following conditions:
</I>&gt;<i> - unless it's a 1.1.1 only issue, we MUST always wait to open the
</I>&gt;<i> backport-to-111 PR until after the master PR has been approved and
</I>&gt;<i> merged (to avoid splitting the discussions among different PRs, which
</I>&gt;<i> make review and revisiting our history very hard)
</I>&gt;<i> - trivial documentation changes, such as fixing typos, can be
</I>&gt;<i> exempted
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It must be clear that although things have changed a lot in the inner
</I>&gt;<i> plumbings, we have so far managed to keep crypto implementations very
</I>&gt;<i> much in sync between 1.1.1 and master, by applying the policy of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;first merge to master, then possibly backport&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I am afraid of in Bernd's proposal, and recent discussions, is
</I>&gt;<i> that committers might be tempted to open PRs changing implementations
</I>&gt;<i> against 1.1.1 first (to avoid frequent rebases due to unrelated
</I>&gt;<i> changes) and let the `master` PR stagnate indefinitely because it
</I>&gt;<i> feels like too much hassle to keep up with the development pace of
</I>&gt;<i> master if your PR collaterally changes certain files.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An example of what can go wrong if we open a 1.1.1 PR concurrently
</I>&gt;<i> with a PR for master can be seen here:
</I>&gt;<i> - `master` PR: <A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/10828">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/10828</A>
</I>&gt;<i> - `1.1.1` PR: <A HREF="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/11411">https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/11411</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I highlight the following problems related to the above example:
</I>&gt;<i> - as you can see the `1.1.1` has been merged, even though the
</I>&gt;<i> `master` one has stalled while discussing which implementation we
</I>&gt;<i> should pick. (this was my fault, I should have applied the `hold`
</I>&gt;<i> label after stating that my approval for 1.1.1 was conditional to
</I>&gt;<i> approving the `master` counterpart)
</I>&gt;<i> - discussion that is integral part of the decision process was split
</I>&gt;<i> among the 2 PRs, with over 40 comments each
</I>&gt;<i> - there is no clear link between the `master` PR and the `1.1.1` PR
</I>&gt;<i> for the same feature (this makes it very difficult to review what is
</I>&gt;<i> the state of the &quot;main&quot; PR, and if we or someone else in some months
</I>&gt;<i> or years needs to go check why we did things the way we did, will
</I>&gt;<i> have a hard time connecting the dots)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also think that the proposal as written is a bit misleading: I
</I>&gt;<i> would very like to keep seeing in 1.1.1 a majority of commits cherry-
</I>&gt;<i> picked from commits merged to master, with explicit tags in the 1.1.1
</I>&gt;<i> commit messages (this helps keeping the git history self-contained
</I>&gt;<i> without a too strong dependency on GitHub).
</I>&gt;<i> I would rephrase the proposal as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Merge to 1.1.1 should only happen after approval of a dedicated
</I>&gt;<i> PR targeting the OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable branch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Potential amendments that I'd like the OTC to consider are:
</I>&gt;<i> a) before the end of the sentence add &quot;, with the optional exclusion
</I>&gt;<i> of trivial documentation-only changes&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> b) after the end of the sentence add &quot;In composing backport pull
</I>&gt;<i> requests, explicit cherry-picking (`git cherry-pick -x`) of relevant
</I>&gt;<i> commits merged to `master` or another stable branch is recommended
</I>&gt;<i> and encouraged whenever possible.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> c) adopt a more general statement:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Merge to any stable branch should only happen after approval of a
</I>&gt;<i> dedicated PR targeting specifically that branch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, in summary, I would agree with the proposal, as I definitely
</I>&gt;<i> think Bernd has a good point about running the 1.1.1 CI for things we
</I>&gt;<i> think should be backported, but requires careful consideration of
</I>&gt;<i> additional requirements to avoid duplicating review efforts,
</I>&gt;<i> splitting discussions that should be kept together, or disrupting our
</I>&gt;<i> processes making 1.1.1 and master diverge more than necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
