<PRE>Earlier this month I started a script to ping stale PRs that were in
certain states.  The script has also been collecting statistics
(trending and snapshot).  I intend to post this monthly and after a
few months with trends and commentary.

PRs that have not had any updates in the last 30 days and are not WIP:

 all  ( 153 issues, median  158  days) of which:

     failed CI  ( 21 issues, median  158  days)
     deferred after 1.1.1  ( 45 issues, median  158  days)
     cla required  ( 24 issues, median  325.0  days)
     waiting for reporter  ( 13 issues, median  252  days)
     waiting for review  ( 3 issues, median  44  days)
     waiting for OMC  ( 3 issues, median  142  days)
     waiting for OTC  ( 2 issues, median  43.5  days)
     all other  ( 42 issues, median  289.0  days)

So, ignoring deferred issues too you could summarise this as:

    Stale PRs waiting for us to do something: 29 (27%)
    Stale PRs waiting for the reporter to do something: 37 (34%)
    Stale PRs with unclear next action: 42 (39%)

Over time I hope we can triage the &quot;all other&quot; PRs with labels so we
know what the next action is on each one.
