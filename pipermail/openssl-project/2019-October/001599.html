I agree with you that it should be removed.


BTW: That's a similar question than your recent question whether
'approval: done' should be removed when the 'ready to merge'
label is added. After sleeping a night over it, I would prefer if
the former were removed. If we would add the 'approval: ' prefix,
then it would be obvious why it makes sense:

 &#160;&#160;&#160; 'approval: review pending'
 &#160;&#160;&#160; 'approval: omc review pending'
 &#160;&#160;&#160; 'approval: done'

 &#160;&#160;&#160; ... 24h grace period ...

 &#160;&#160;&#160; 'approval: ready to merge'

The transition diagram would be much easier to remember, in particular
for the case when an approval needs to be revoked because some change
was added (or even force-pushed) after approval.



&gt;<i> Another issue I encountered was with the &quot;closed: *&quot; labels. &quot;closed&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't quite seem right to me. Whether something is closed or open is
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat independent of the states that those labels convey. For example
</I>&gt;<i> we might want to label something as &quot;not a bug&quot; but leave it open for a
</I>&gt;<i> little while to allow the reporter to respond or argue why it really
</I>&gt;<i> should be treated as a bug. Similarly with &quot;wont fix&quot; and maybe even
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;duplicate&quot;.
</I>
Actually the 'rejected: *' prefix would be the most appropriate. I just hesitated
because it sounded so unfriendly. If you have a more friendly proposal, I'd be
happy to hear about it. Otherwise I would just suggest to use it instead of
'closed: *'.
