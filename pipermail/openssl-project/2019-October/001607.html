Not sure about the &quot;resolved: fixed&quot; one...most of the time where we
resolve an issue by fixing it, it gets closed automatically. Adding a
label probably doesn't add much. I suppose it might be useful in the
case where someone reports a bug that is *already* fixed in a later version.

&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160; ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the unresolved issues, an 'unresolved: *' label makes sense:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160; &quot;unresolved: &lt;some reason&gt;&quot;
</I>
Possible reasons for marking something as unresolved:

- The question is stale - no activity for a prolonged period
- Off topic - the question is about something not directly related to
OpenSSL
- Unable to help - despite our best efforts we weren't able to figure
out an answer
- Lack of information - we requested information and it wasn't forthcoming

Not sure if we would want a label for all of those or not.
