I don't think we need a reinterpretation, or even a change, of the existing policy for
this specific case,&#160; since already now the *entire* engine api can only be deprecated
in version 3.0 and removed afterwards according to the policy cited by Matt.

We can simply add the missing accessor as bugfix to 1.1.1 and 3.0, and immediately
deprecate it on the latter. The only difference will be that we end up with n+1 deprecated
functions instead of n&#160; (for some natural number n) for version 3.0.

Even after 3.0 is released and as long as 1.1.1 LTS is still supported, we can proceed
in the same way without violating existing policies.
