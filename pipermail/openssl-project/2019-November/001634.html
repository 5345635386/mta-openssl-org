The builds on master have been failing for *much* longer than that. They
should be succeeded on the PRs, but its the extended tests that fail.

</I>
The build failures mostly come from the external tests (or that was the
case I haven't checked recently). The problem with these is that, on
occasion we need the maintainers of these packages to help us track down
a problem. Or in some cases we actually need them to make a change (for
example because something changed on master which revealed that they
were relying on some behaviour in master which they really shouldn't be
relying on).

Once one of them is failing then multiple errors can build up and they
get masked by the earlier failure.

I'll try and find some time to take another pass at the current
failures. I suspect the answer might be to disable some of the external
tests.
