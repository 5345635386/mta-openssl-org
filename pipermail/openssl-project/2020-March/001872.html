</I>
I believe that making these function return an error unconditionally is
a breaking change as well and for that reason I prefer removing them
completely or actually removing the FIPS_mode_set() and making the
FIPS_mode() to query the fips properties of the default context.

As for the use-cases the FIPS_mode() call has in the applications I
know of this implementation would be completely OK. If the call is
removed these applications would call the
EVP_default_properties_is_fips_enabled on the default context anyway.
The applications do not call FIPS_mode() to query for the FIPS
compliance but they use it to change their behavior i.e. prefer or
select different algorithms to be used.

The current implementation in the PR - unconditionally returning error
- is completely useless. It would make some (not much) sense if we
aimed for ABI compatibility with 3.0 however that is definitely not the
case so the only reasonable thing is to either try to emulate the
behavior as much as possible or remove completely so the users of the
API would know immediately that they have to be changed.
