I'm not sure I understand...  Are you saying that you want OPENSSL_CTX
to be non-opaque?  What for?  The current implementation is basically
as a bag of &quot;things&quot;, where the exact &quot;thing&quot; is identified with an
index.  The rest is defined by every sub-system that wants to store
&quot;things&quot; in a library context, i.e. they must get themselves an index
for each type of &quot;thing&quot;, and then they simply get it from the library
context.

Do you need to know exactly how the bag of &quot;things&quot; is organized?

The diverse sub-system structures may be opaque or non-opaque as they
see fit, of course.

</I>
You're talking about the property string cache...  yeah, I see no real
reason to store them away in a library context, it's not really like
we'd gain anything by having several of them with potentially the
exact same information.

So yeah, we do need to think about what stuff should go into the
library context and what shouldn't.  (I think Rich has voiced the
opinion that error stacks and error string tables shouldn't be tied to
a library context, and for the moment, I agree with that view)

Cheers,
Richard
