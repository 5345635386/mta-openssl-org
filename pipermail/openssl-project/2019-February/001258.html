</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that there is a missing box.  Specifically, the PERL API wrappers
</I>
Later on you seem to clarify that by &quot;PERL API&quot; you mean &quot;Net::SSLeay&quot; but
I just want to double-check.

&gt;<i> that are used in the test bench.  I believe that the &quot;applications&quot; are
</I>&gt;<i> a serious problem as there are (in 1.1.1) still many things that are very
</I>&gt;<i> difficult (sometimes, it seems, impossible) to do programmatically, and which
</I>&gt;<i> the test cases actually simply shell out to the application to do.
</I>&gt;<i> An example of this is adding certain extensions to a certificate when
</I>&gt;<i> generating it, which is only really possible by loading pieces of
</I>&gt;<i> configuration file in.
</I>
It might we worth raising github issues to point out these omissions.

&gt;<i> So what I'd like to see is to remove many of the applications from the core
</I>&gt;<i> of OpenSSL, put them into a seperate package using better-documented API
</I>&gt;<i> calls.  Let them evolve according their own time-scale, probably taking
</I>&gt;<i> patches faster without disrupting the underlying libraries.
</I>
In the vein of your later comment about &quot;20 years of twisty code&quot;, I'm
actually somewhat inclined to clave off the applications and leave them
alone, so that people needing bug-for-bug compatibility can keep it.  Then
we could rewrite the functionality in question with a more maintainable
structure in a way that would also function as examplar API usage.

&gt;<i> My observation is that the Perl testing system is used to drive the tests,
</I>&gt;<i> but the tests do not actually use the Perl API wrapper for OpenSSL, but
</I>&gt;<i> rather rely on the vast number of .c files in test/*.
</I>&gt;<i> In other (more purely agile) projects, the test cases often serve as
</I>&gt;<i> documentation as to how to use the API.  In OpenSSL, the test cases
</I>&gt;<i> rely too much on the openssl &quot;applications&quot;, and the API is hidden.
</I>
So, when I write new code that requires tests (which is basically all new
code, try as I may to convince myself otherwise), the first thing I try to
do is put in an API-only test that's a &quot;standalone&quot; executable (ignore
sslapitest.c which is not standalone but functionally is so) to exercise
narrowly the functionality in question.  Only if it's a big hassle,
requires additional (certificate) input and/or configuration files, etc.,
do I fail over to using the &quot;application&quot; as the testbed.  There's a
tradeoff, and while the current playing field often biases that tradeoff in
a direction I'd rather not go, changing the playing field is more work than
I have time to take on while a sitting IETF AD.

&gt;<i> This would involve adopting some or all of Net::SSLeay.
</I>&gt;<i> While there would be some initial duplication of effort, I think that over
</I>&gt;<i> time it would sort itself out.  Perl is no longer as cool as it used to be (I
</I>&gt;<i> still like it) and maybe someone would argue for Python3 or something, and
</I>&gt;<i> frankly I don't care which.
</I>
I don't think that OpenSSL itself should adopt Net::SSLeay, even though we
do seem to have one of the higher perl usage fractions of the open-source
projects I interact with.  We have enough on our hands with the core C
libraries to modernize.

&gt;<i> What I care about is that the test cases actually test the API, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> depend upon 20 years of twisty code in the &quot;applications&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> And that the applications are permitted to grow/change/adapt to people's
</I>&gt;<i> needs, rather than living in a hard spot between developer needs and end
</I>&gt;<i> user needs, pissing off both groups.
</I>
I agree that mixing user needs and developer needs is a recipe for sadness.
I'm not sure that actually tearing them apart from the current &quot;apps&quot; is
something that we can realistically do while preserving our goal of
cross-release stability.
