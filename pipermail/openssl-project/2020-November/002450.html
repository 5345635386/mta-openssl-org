<PRE>Hi Paul,

a warm welcome also from my side.
Great that you are strengthening the team,
unloading work in particular from Matt and Richard.

I'm the OpenSSL team member who joined most recently before you, after
getting invited to
become a Committer in January, while contributing a heavy load of
certificate management
code and on this occasion also many related small extensions and more or
less general fixes.
I'm using this occasion to drop in the same way as you did a few lines
on my background
also to the other project members, as these might be of interest for
them, too.

I had started using OpenSSL also quite a number of years back, mostly on
the command line,
in particular with a PKCS#11 engine for using the CardOS-based Siemens
employee ID card -
thus kind of related with your use case at the US Navy.&#160; At Siemens
Corporate Technology
I also had a major project with Boeing Phantom Works on secure airplane
software update.
My current focus is PKI-related development, research, consulting, and
standardization.

On the personal side, I live with my small family just east of Munich,
Bavaria, Germany.
I love mountaineering and photography, and since 1.5 years my wife and
me have become
happy campervan users, which combines well with our base being pretty
close to the Alps.

Cheers,

&#160;&#160;&#160; David

</I>&gt;<i> Before coming to OpenSSL, I was the chief technology officer at Thursby Software Systems.  My team developed a smart card application for iOS and Android for the US government and military. We used OpenSSL FIPS for these applications.  I am familiar with using OpenSSL as a developer and with public key encryption in general. Our solution for the US Navy Reserve was probably the first bring your own device (BYOD) project to obtain an authority to operate issued by the Navy Cyber command. OpenSSL was an invaluable part of that accomplishment!

This is a recursive activity where you build the Jeep, drive it, break it and fix it.  Then do it all again for more fun. I am married with three grown children and quite a few grandchildren.
