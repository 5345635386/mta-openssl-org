<PRE>## Background

As part of the discussion in [issue #8435], it was highlighted that both
in 1.1.1 and master we are missing tests to validate decoded SM2 keys.
The `openssl pkey -check` (or `pkey -pubcheck` to validate only the
public key component) command allows to explicitly execute the
validation checks, while on regular operations (e.g., using `pkeyutl` or
`dgst`) no validation of the input keys is normally done (probably by
design).

In [PR 13359] I am adding new tests, using `openssl pkey -check` to
validate specific key corner cases, for P-256 as an exemplar for EC keys
and for SM2 keys.
Unfortunately `openssl pkey -check` behavior currently shows the result
of the validation only in the text output, so parsing of `stdout` would
require measuring the test results.
In the PR I am proposing to change the behavior of `openssl pkey` so
that an early exit is triggered if `-check` or `-pubcheck` validation
fails, exiting with a failure exit status: [apps/pkey.c changes].

This is a breaking change in the behavior of `openssl pkey` and the
reason why I am planning to raise a vote to approve this change.

Note that during our OTC meeting today it was proposed as an alternative
to have a more generic vote on approving this kind of change in general
for all similar situations across all the apps.
While I am not opposed to such a decision, I am afraid having such a
generic vote might be quite difficult:

- I am not sure I can express in a clear and unambiguous what are the
  conditions to fall within &quot;similar situations&quot;, making such a
  decision hard to execute in practical terms;
- I personally cannot commit to execute such vote across all apps and
  all relevant conditions: doing so requires extensive review of the
  apps logic in parsing the CLI switches, of conformity with existing
  documentation and an exploration of existing use patterns in the user
  codebase to see what are the expectations and estimate the impact of
  such changes. It would also require writing an extensive battery of
  tests to ensure we behave as documented/expected across apps and CLI
  switches.
- The amount of work to which we would commit after such a generic
  decision, and the impact it could have on the behavior consistency
  w.r.t. 3.0 and 1.1.1, would make me think such a decision is more in
  the realm of strategic objectives, for which an OMC vote would be more
  appropriate.

For these reasons, at this time, I am opting to propose an OTC vote on
the single case of the behavior change of `pkey -check`/`pkey -pubcheck`
rather than a more generic one, and I will let others decide if a more
generic vote is also required/appropriate and if it can be framed
exclusively within the technical prerogatives of the OTC decision
process.

## Proposed vote text

    Change the behavior of `pkey -check`
    and `pkey -pubcheck` in 3.0 to trigger an
    early exit if validation fails, returning a
    failure exit status to the parent process.

---

Please leave feedback relevant to the proposed vote text and the scope
of the vote.
In absence of feedback I plan to open the actual vote in 24h.



Cheers,

Nicola
