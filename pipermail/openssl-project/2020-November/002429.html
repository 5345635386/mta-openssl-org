<PRE>Usually the labs provide assurances on the key generation and the
other cryptographic operations, including validation, but have special
provisions to avoid providing assurances on key serialization and
deserialization.

This seems particularly true in the context of the FIPS validation for
OpenSSL, where the encoders/decoders are outside the scope of the FIPS
module and of validation.

The issue that triggered this discussion is particularly an issue of
encoding/decoding: the user application uses a custom format, and that
is the reason why the `EVP_PKEY` object is built from an `EC_KEY`
object built from scratch.
The application has only these ways to validate if the created
`EVP_PKEY` object is valid from a programmer's perspective AND as a
cryptographic object:

- EVP_PKEY_check (check an EVP_PKEY keypair)
- EVP_PKEY_public_check (check an EVP_PKEY pubkey, or just the public
component of an EVP_PKEY keypair)
- EVP_PKEY_param_check (check an EVP_PKEY params object, or just the
params component of an EVP_PKEY keypair or pubkey)

By design the consistency checks and validation checks are omitted
unless these functions are called, and there is no
EVP_PKEY_private_check.

To me this proves that what was described as a &quot;breaking change&quot; in
3.0 with strict EC keymgmt, is instead a programmer error in the
application that abused the API with an incomplete initialization,
which would have been detected if the dedicated validation functions
were called appropriately.
Even if the security policies that apply to the users of that
application wouldn't require to validate the cryptographic properties
of the key every time they are loaded because of external processes
and assurances, the developers of the application would have
discovered they were abusing the API if they tried validating the
half-initialized objects even just in development builds, which in my
opinion debunks the &quot;lack of enforcement&quot; argument that partially
supported the discussion that led to this vote.



In light of this I would dare say that:

a) the current &quot;strict&quot; state of EC keymgmt in 3.0 does not represent
a &quot;breaking change&quot; w.r.t 1.1.1, as it only catches existing API
abuses that were catched in 1.1.1, if only the half-initialized
objects were validated
b) relaxing the &quot;keypair assumption&quot; for EVP_PKEY objects is entirely
a new feature


Neither of these points makes the vote &quot;invalid&quot;, but they could
change some of the casted votes, and they would strengthen my -1 in a
-2 if it were an option.

P.S. For the record, given that I expressed this mostly in the virtual
meetings rather than in the discussion thread in the mailing list,
while from these emails it might seem like I hate with fiery rage the
idea of relaxing the keypair assumption, this is not really the case.
My main concern is changing this deeply rooted and pervasive
assumption in the timeframe of the 3.0 release, and with (IMO)
insufficient test coverage to make sure that we can transition to a
more relaxed model without introducing defects that could translate
into security risks.

</I>&gt;<i> Background to the vote:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The OTC meeting today discussed the problems raised by issue #12612. In
</I>&gt;<i> summary the problem is that there has been a long standing, widespread
</I>&gt;<i> and documented assumption that an EVP_PKEY with a private key will
</I>&gt;<i> always also have the public key component.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In spite of this it turns out that in the EC implementation in 1.1.1 it
</I>&gt;<i> was perfectly possible to create an EVP_PKEY with only a private key and
</I>&gt;<i> no public key - and it was also possible to use such an EVP_PKEY in a
</I>&gt;<i> signing operation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current 3.0 code in master introduced an explicit check (in line
</I>&gt;<i> with the long held assumption) that the public key was present and
</I>&gt;<i> rejected keys where this was not the case. This caused a backwards
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility break for some users (as discussed at length in #12612).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The OTC discussed a proposal that we should relax our conceptual model
</I>&gt;<i> in this regards and conceptually allow EVP_PKEYs to exist that only have
</I>&gt;<i> the private component without the public component - although individual
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm implementations may still require both.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is possible to automatically generate the public component from the
</I>&gt;<i> private for many algorithms, although this may come at a performance and
</I>&gt;<i> (potentially) a security cost.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The proposal discussed was that while relaxing the conceptual model,
</I>&gt;<i> most of the existing implementations would still require both. The EC
</I>&gt;<i> implementation would be relaxed however. This essentially gives largely
</I>&gt;<i> compatible behaviour between 1.1.1 and 3.0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The vote text is as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> topic: For 3.0 EVP_PKEY keys, the OTC accepts the following resolution:
</I>&gt;<i> * relax the conceptual model to allow private keys to exist without public
</I>&gt;<i>  components;
</I>&gt;<i> * all implementations apart from EC require the public component to be
</I>&gt;<i> present;
</I>&gt;<i> * relax implementation for EC key management to allow private keys that
</I>&gt;<i> do not
</I>&gt;<i>  contain public keys and
</I>&gt;<i> * our decoders unconditionally generate the public key (where possible).
