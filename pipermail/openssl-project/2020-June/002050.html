I am happy to see 11968 landed; some informal testing that I hope to make
more formal soon seems to show a ~20% slowdown/regression for large RNG
requests going from 1.1.1d to 1.1.g, and 11968 provided substantially more
significant of a speedup (again, very informal testing, though).

In this case you could say that the &quot;bug&quot; is that we're only calling AES on
a block at a time despite having much more effective backends available for
multi-block calls.

&gt;<i> We have always said that the stable releases should only receive bug and
</I>&gt;<i> security fixes. Performance improvements have been a bit of a grey area,
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. a few lines of code that significantly improves the performance of
</I>&gt;<i> a particular algorithm or codepath could reasonably be justified as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;fixing a performance bug&quot;. OTOH bringing in whole new files of
</I>&gt;<i> assembler seems to go way beyond that definition.
</I>
There's probably some semi-subtle distinction to make along the lines of
&quot;making the algorithm more efficient&quot; vs &quot;using a new algorithm, that
happens to run faster&quot;, with the latter counting as a feature.

&gt;<i> However, when I tried to find a reference to the policy which says
</I>&gt;<i> exactly what we are allowed to backport I could find one. Do we have
</I>&gt;<i> such a thing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In any case I think we should develop a much more explicit policy that
</I>&gt;<i> will enable us to decide whether PRs such as 11188 are reasonable or
</I>&gt;<i> not. See for example Ubuntu's Stable Release Updates policy:

I agree that having something written down will be very useful, even if
just as a fixed benchmark against which to think about how exceptional any
given &quot;exception case&quot; is where we want to deviate from it.
