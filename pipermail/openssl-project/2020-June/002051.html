<PRE>I&#8217;d also support 11968 being merged.  I find the recent discussion and the likelihood of all major distros (supporting the S390x) picking up the patches fairly compelling, especially since the same people will be maintaining it.

I would need to go and double check the non-S390x specific parts for possible breakage but the bulk of the changes are S390x specific.


I support formalising the rules better than we have at the moment.  Even if this is in conflict with the above.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PR #11968 was a significant recent PR that backported AES CTR-DRBG

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this case you could say that the &quot;bug&quot; is that we're only calling AES on
</I>&gt;<i> a block at a time despite having much more effective backends available for
</I>&gt;<i> multi-block calls.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We have always said that the stable releases should only receive bug and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> security fixes. Performance improvements have been a bit of a grey area,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> e.g. a few lines of code that significantly improves the performance of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a particular algorithm or codepath could reasonably be justified as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;fixing a performance bug&quot;. OTOH bringing in whole new files of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assembler seems to go way beyond that definition.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's probably some semi-subtle distinction to make along the lines of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;making the algorithm more efficient&quot; vs &quot;using a new algorithm, that
</I>&gt;<i> happens to run faster&quot;, with the latter counting as a feature.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, when I tried to find a reference to the policy which says
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exactly what we are allowed to backport I could find one. Do we have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such a thing?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In any case I think we should develop a much more explicit policy that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will enable us to decide whether PRs such as 11188 are reasonable or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not. See for example Ubuntu's Stable Release Updates policy:
