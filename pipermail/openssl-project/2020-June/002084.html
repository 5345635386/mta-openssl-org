<PRE>Sorry yes, I meant to refer to the open PR with the s390 support, I picked
the wrong number!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In light of how the discussion evolved I would say that not only there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is consensus on supporting the definition of a detailed policy on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; backports and the definitions of what are the requirements for regular
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; releases vs LTS releases (other than the longer support timeframe),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but also highlights a need to do it sooner rather than later!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This seems a job for the OMC, as it falls under:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; makes all decisions regarding management and strategic direction of the
</I>&gt;<i> project; including:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - business requirements;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - feature requirements;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - platform requirements;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - roadmap requirements and priority;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - end-of-life decisions;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - release timing and requirement decisions;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My contribution to the discussion is to ask if the OMC has plans for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; addressing this in the very short term.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think its unlikely we are going to get to a policy in the short term.
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me we are still some way away from a consensus here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If working on a policy is going to be a medium-term effort, maybe it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be opportune to call an OTC vote specific to #11968 under the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current release requirements defined by the OMC (or lack thereof).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 11968 is already merged and, AFAIK, no one has proposed reverting it. If
</I>&gt;<i> such a PR was raised then a vote might be a way forward for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 11188 is the more pressing problem because that is currently unmerged
</I>&gt;<i> and stuck. That has an OTC hold on it (placed there by me), so an OTC
</I>&gt;<i> vote seems appropriate. If a vote is held it should be to decide whether
</I>&gt;<i> backporting it is consistent with our current understanding of the
</I>&gt;<i> policy such as it is. It is for the OMC to decide whether a different
</I>&gt;<i> policy should be introduced at some point in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Matt
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We already saw a few comments in favor of evaluating backporting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #11968 as an exception, in light of the supporting arguments, even if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it was in conflict with the current policy understanding or the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; upcoming policy formulation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So if we could swiftly agree on this being an OTC or OMC vote, I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; urge to have a dedicated discussion/vote specific to #11968, while
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more detailed policies and definitions are in the process of being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; formulated.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - What is the consensus on splitting the 2 discussions?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - If splitting the discussions, is deciding on #11968 an OTC or OMC
</I>&gt;<i> matter?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nicola
