<PRE>In April I started a script to ping stale PRs that were in certain
states.  The script has also been collecting statistics (trending and
snapshot).  I intend to post this monthly and after a few months with
trends and commentary.

PRs that have not had any updates in the last 30 days and are not WIP:

all  ( 158 issues, median  219  days) of which:

 failed CI  ( 28 issues, median  114.0  days)
 deferred after 1.1.1  ( 40 issues, median  219.0  days)
 cla required  ( 18 issues, median  442.0  days)
 waiting for reporter  ( 16 issues, median  299.5  days)
 waiting for review  ( 2 issues, median  40.5  days)
 waiting for OMC  ( 3 issues, median  83  days)
 waiting for OTC  ( 3 issues, median  55  days)
 all other  ( 48 issues, median  215.0  days)

So, ignoring deferred issues too you could summarise this as:

 Stale PRs waiting for us to do something: 36 (last months: 27,29)
 Stale PRs waiting for the reporter to do something: 34 (last months: 34,37)
 Stale PRs with unclear next action: 48 (last months: 46,42)

There really shouldn't be anything &quot;waiting for OMC/OTC/review&quot; that
is over 30 days; many of these did get a decision and the state just
isn't updated.

Over time I hope we can triage the &quot;all other&quot; PRs with labels so we
know what the next action is on each one.
