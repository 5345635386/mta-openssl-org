In my opinion the 1.1.1 should not enter such strongly restricted phase
earlier than after the 3.0 is released.

Ideally, if we had releases based on some predictable cadence and not
rather feature based ones, we should have 3 active branches - master
for development of new features, one branch with bug fixes and even
non-invasive performance fixes, and one branch for LTS where only
security fixes with above than low severity and severe bug fixes would
be applied.
