You may have hit on a key aspect of how we are disconnected, here.

I was under the impression that (as is the case for many OSS projects), the
fact that 1.1.1 is an LTS release means that we enter a separate &quot;LTS mode&quot;
at the &quot;beginning of a long-term support period&quot; (as Wikipedia puts it) but
that there is some period prior to the start of the long-term support
period for which the STS policies apply.

So, are you considering that 1.1.1 is now, and has always been, in LTS mode
because it is marked as an &quot;LTS release&quot;?  Or is there a separate STS
period before it transitions to &quot;LTS mode&quot;?

&gt;<i> What you (Ben and Matt) are both describing is not LTS but STS ... these
</I>&gt;<i> are different concepts.
</I>
AFAICT the thread started with just talk of merging to stable release
branches; LTS didn't come up until Kurt's note.  I certainly was not
considering the LTS policy in my earlier comments.

&gt;<i> For LTS the focus is *stability *and *reduced risk of disruption *which
</I>&gt;<i> alters the judgement on what is appropriate to put into a release.
</I>&gt;<i> It then becomes a test of &quot;is this bug fix worth the risk&quot; with the general
</I>&gt;<i> focus on lowest possible risk which stops this sort of thing happening
</I>&gt;<i> unless a critical feature is broken.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All of the &quot;edge case&quot; examples presented all involve substantial changes
</I>&gt;<i> to implementations and carry an inherent risk of breaking something else -
</I>&gt;<i> and that is the issue.
</I>
IMO, if we're in LTS mode, if any of the proposed edge cases came up that
would indicate that we failed at the LTS policy in the first place.

&gt;<i> It would be different if we had a full regression test suite across all the
</I>&gt;<i> platforms and variations on platforms that our users are operating on - but
</I>&gt;<i> we don't.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We don't compare performance between releases or for any updates in our
</I>&gt;<i> test suite so it isn't part of our scope for release readiness - if this is
</I>&gt;<i> such a critical thing that must be fixed then it is something that we
</I>&gt;<i> should be measuring and checking as a release condition - but we don't -
</I>&gt;<i> because it actually isn't that critical.
</I>
It can translate to real monetary impact in some cases (e.g., at scale).
But I can't directly refute your point, it is true.
