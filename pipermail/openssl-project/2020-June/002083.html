I think its unlikely we are going to get to a policy in the short term.
It seems to me we are still some way away from a consensus here.

&gt;<i> If working on a policy is going to be a medium-term effort, maybe it
</I>&gt;<i> would be opportune to call an OTC vote specific to #11968 under the

</I>
11968 is already merged and, AFAIK, no one has proposed reverting it. If
such a PR was raised then a vote might be a way forward for it.

11188 is the more pressing problem because that is currently unmerged
and stuck. That has an OTC hold on it (placed there by me), so an OTC
vote seems appropriate. If a vote is held it should be to decide whether
backporting it is consistent with our current understanding of the
policy such as it is. It is for the OMC to decide whether a different
policy should be introduced at some point in the future.
