In my opinion that would open a can of worms. Such branch would
inevitably mean there will be request for the 1.1.2 release and I do
not think it would be a good idea to have it. It would seriously
stretch the team resources IMHO.

It would be much better to have the rules not tightened for 1.1.1 right
now (i.e. still allow for example the performance improvements and
support for newer hardware) and tighten them only after the 3.0 release
is final.

Still, I do not think allowing any truly new features other than the
performance and HW support on 1.1.1 is worth it.
