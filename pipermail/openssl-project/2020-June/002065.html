I think previously we have said that a new target is a new feature and
therefore haven't allowed it. But even this I think is a grey area. If a
target could be added simply by adding some lines to Configure, probably
the risk to our existing users is very low. OTOH, if adding a platform
means adding lots of ifdef hackery throughout the codebase then the risk
of something going wrong is significantly higher.

</I>
My immediate reaction to that is no - it shouldn't go to 1.1.1. That
would impact a very high proportion of our user base.
