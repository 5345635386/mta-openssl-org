The problem is that there is not really fully consistent convention
followed currently (even in 1.1.1, not counting the API additions in
3.0).

For example if we would like to follow the convention _fully_ we would
have to rename these new EVP_MAC functions:

int EVP_MAC_init(EVP_MAC_CTX *ctx);
      
int EVP_MAC_update(EVP_MAC_CTX *ctx, const unsigned char *data, size_t datalen);
 
int EVP_MAC_final(EVP_MAC_CTX *ctx, unsigned char *out, size_t *outl, size_t outsize);

to something like:

int EVP_MacInit(EVP_MAC_CTX *ctx);
      
int EVP_MacUpdate(EVP_MAC_CTX *ctx, const unsigned char *data, size_t datalen);
 
int EVP_MacFinal(EVP_MAC_CTX *ctx, unsigned char *out, size_t *outl, size_t outsize);

or at least

int EVP_MACInit(EVP_MAC_CTX *ctx);
      
int EVP_MACUpdate(EVP_MAC_CTX *ctx, const unsigned char *data, size_t datalen);
 
int EVP_MACFinal(EVP_MAC_CTX *ctx, unsigned char *out, size_t *outl, size_t outsize);

Should we do that? I hope for the sheer ugliness of the supposedly
consistent names that we do not.

Fortunately or unfortunately depending on personal opinons we have
already diverged from that pattern with EVP_PKEY API.

And I actually hope we could add at least non-CamelCase aliases to the
existing (non-deprecated) CamelCase functions because they were always
the worst offender of the API consistency.
