<PRE>During June I updated the stale PR script to start to ping reporters where
issues were in the &quot;changes requested&quot; state.  I corrected some issues that
were incorrectly in this state where changes had been supplied.  I also got the
script to close the issues still &quot;waiting for CLA&quot; that had had no response for
several months of automated reminders.  Finally, there were a few issues in
&quot;waiting for review&quot; state that were given reviews or otherwise updated.

PRs that have not had any updates in the last 30 days and are not WIP:

all  ( 132 issues, median  248  days) of which:

 failed CI  ( 22 issues, median  183 days)
 deferred after 1.1.1  ( 46 issues)
 cla required  ( 0 issues)
 waiting for reporter  ( 8 issues, median  255 days)
 waiting for review  ( 0 issues)
 waiting for OMC  ( 1 issue)
 waiting for OTC  ( 4 issues, median  44 days)
 all other  ( 51 issues, median  239 days)

So, ignoring deferred issues too you could summarise this as:

 Stale PRs waiting for us to do something: 27 (last months: 36, 27, 29)
 Stale PRs waiting for the reporter to do something: 8 (last months: 34, 34, 37)
 Stale PRs with unclear next action: 51 (last months: 48, 46, 42)
 Total Stale PRs: 86 (last months: 118, 107, 108)

There really shouldn't be anything &quot;waiting for OMC/OTC/review&quot; that
is over 30 days; many of these did get a decision and the state just
isn't updated.

Over time I hope we can triage the &quot;all other&quot; PRs with labels so we
know what the next action is on each one.
