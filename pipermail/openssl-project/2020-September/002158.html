<PRE>So when we have a PR in a state where any CI is marked as failing I
lump them into a single &quot;failed CI&quot; state.  The stale (over 30 day old
untouched) ones are shown below.  But most of them (if not all) are
not actually CI failures.  Aside from fixing the CI, one solution
would be a label &quot;Ignore CI failure&quot; which can be manually set by a
committer who reviews the fail and it's harmless, then I could have
the bot ignore failed CI when that label is present.  (And perhaps the
bot also resets the label if the CI gets restarted due to changes).
That would help have things in the right state bucket and can be acted
on/reminded properly.
