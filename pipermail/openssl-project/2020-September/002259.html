<PRE>I am using openssl 1.1.1d. I found out around 228 bytes are being directly
lost (as per valgrind) report. I have one application which uses curl
(7.64) and I wrote the same application using POCO HTTPS and I got the same
result.

I thought it could be related to the cipher suit. I can see the leak is
dependent on the URL being used (all were https). For one of the urls, it
was leaking 228 (directly) per connection and disconnection. For one of the
urls, the same code doesn't leak atall (no matter how many times you run
that code in a for loop).

For the urls which were leaking, the following cipher suites were being
used:
1. SSL connection using TLSv1.2 / ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
2. SSL connection using TLSv1.2 / ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384

Here is the valgrind summary:
