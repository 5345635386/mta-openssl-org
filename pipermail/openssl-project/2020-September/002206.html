</I>
I must be misunderstanding your point because I don't follow your logic
at all.

In your example above the proposal seems clear (to me):

&quot;Where present the TYPE argument should always be first. In constructors
or object factory type functions (such as a &quot;fetch&quot; function), the key
argument that identifies the thing be constructed should be placed first
(if such an argument exists).&quot;

Your example is a &quot;factory type&quot; or constructor. Therefore the argument
that identifies the thing being constructued should be first, i.e. the name.

The section of the policy says:

&quot;The remaining argument list should be put into order of importance.&quot;

Only then does it go on to list where the ctx sits in that order of
importance. The phrase &quot;the remaining argument list&quot; indicates that that
ordering is subordinate to the preceding paragraph.

So this is the correct form according to my proposed policy:

TYPE *TYPE_make_from_ctx(char *name,TYPE_CTX *ctx)


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Separately, we should have consistency in the naming of the functions
</I>&gt;<i> which take an OPENSSL_CTX - the _with_libctx makes no sense now that we
</I>&gt;<i> settled on OPENSSL_CTX rather than OPENSSL_LIBCTX or OPENSSL_LIB_CTX as
</I>&gt;<i> the naming. We also have a pile of _ex functions that were introduced
</I>&gt;<i> just to add an OPENSSL_CTX - those should be consistently named. 
</I>
The policy is clear. We are adding extended forms of existing functions.
Therefore &quot;_with_libctx&quot; is not consistent with the policy. &quot;_ex&quot; (or
&quot;_ex2&quot; if necessary), is.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The PR should cover that context of how we name the variations of
</I>&gt;<i> functions which add the OPENSSL_CTX reference.
</I>
IMO, it does. They should be called &quot;*_ex&quot; as stated in chapter 6.2. I
don't see why we need to special case OPENSSL_CTX in the policy. Its
written in a generic way an can be applied to the OPENSSL_CTX case.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The suggested rules for extended functions is inconsistent in stating
</I>&gt;<i> the order &quot;should be retained&quot; and then allowing for inserting &quot;at any
</I>&gt;<i> point&quot;.
</I>
This is not inconsistent. The *order* must be retained. Inserting
additional arguments does *not* change the order. So according to the
policy, if you have a function:

FOO_do_something(bar, wibble, blah);

Then this is ok:

FOO_do_something(new, bar, wibble, blah);

As is this:

FOO_do_something(bar, new, wibble, blah);

And this:

FOO_do_something(bar, wibble, blah, new);

But *not* this (because the order of existing arguments is different):

FOO_do_something(blah, wibble, bar, new);



&gt;<i> IHMO either the new function must preserve the existing order and just
</I>&gt;<i> add to the end (to easy migration) or it should conform to the naming
</I>&gt;<i> scheme and parameter argument order for new functions - one of those
</I>&gt;<i> should be the driver rather than basically creating something that is
</I>&gt;<i> neither - not easy to migrate to and also not following the documented
</I>&gt;<i> order. We should be trying to achieve one of those two objectives.
</I>
I disagree that that should be an objective.

IMO *the* most confusing thing would be to *change* an existing ordering
(for example swap two existing parameters around). I see no problem with
adding new ones anywhere that's appropriate.
