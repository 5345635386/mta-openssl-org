<PRE>The example given was EVP_PKEY_get_() and from the API name it is fairly clear what the first param should be EVP_PKEY *pkey (the API tells you this).

For the fetch case, I still think that the algorithm is the most important param.
Libctx, propq are optional parameters as far as I am concerned.

If it is decided that the libctx is more important then the API should really be something like this..
OSSL_LIBCTX_MD_fetch(), (and I dont know if that is a good idea.)..

In some places where libctx is used it is a second class parameter whose only job is to perform a sub task of fetching during a bigger operation (such as in a load),
And in these cases it should not be the first parameter..

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I hear, even though not in such terms, is an argument of the

</I>&gt;<i> In relation to EVP_XXX_fetch(), it seems to be more of a factory (or

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think, BTW, that this really comes down to how we view the library

</I>&gt;<i> explicitly, but clearly visible in code or how we argue about it):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - framework
</I>&gt;<i> - scope (I'm unsure if that differs much from framework)
</I>&gt;<i> - factory / factory pool
</I>&gt;<i> - bag of resources
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I have zero problems viewing it as all of these combined,
</I>&gt;<i> but that requires us to be clear on how it's used in different places.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be deduced so it isn't (as) important in the API.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That would basically indicate you would (applying the same pattern/rule in a different context)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> int EVP_PKEY_get_int_param(EVP_PKEY *pkey, const char *key_name, int *out);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To the following (putting what you want as the most important rather than from):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> int EVP_PKEY_get_int_param(char *key_name, EVP_PKEY *pkey, int *out);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or pushing it right to the end after the output parameter:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> int EVP_PKEY_get_int_param(char *key_name, int *out,EVP_PKEY *pkey);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The context of where things come from is actually the most critical item in any of the APIs we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even though what you want to get from where you want to get it is in the point of the API call you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to specify where from first as that context sets the frame of the call.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Think of it around this way - we could have an implementation where we remember the last key that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we have used and allow you to simply indicate you use the last key or if we didn't want the last
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> key used to be able to specify it via a non-NULL pointer. This isn't that unusual an API but not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something I'm suggesting we add - just trying to get the point across that you are still thinking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of global and libctx as something super special with an exception in its handling rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applying a general rule which is pretty much what we use everywhere else.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And in which case where you generally don't provide a reference as there is some default meaning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for it in general and can provide a reference for that sort of API would this make sense to you:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> int EVP_PKEY_get_int_param(char *key_name, int *out,EVP_PKEY *pkey);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If pkey is NULL then you use the last key that you referenced, if it is not then you use the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specified pkey. For the application the specific key_name is the most important thing (using your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> argument that basically states the &quot;what&quot; is what counts). 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would suggest that you really would still want to place the EVP_PKEY first - even if you had a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defaulting mechanism of referring to the last key used. Conceptually you always have to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> knowledge of from-where when you are performing a function. And that *context* is what is the most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important.
