<PRE>The vote has been closed, the verdict is

accepted:  yes  (for: 9, against: 0, abstained: 0, not voted: 2)


topic: Accept the OTC voting policy as defined:

       The proposer of a vote is ultimately responsible for updating the votes.txt
       file in the repository.  Outside of a face to face meeting, voters MUST reply
       to the vote email indicating their preference and optionally their reasoning.
       Voters MAY update the votes.txt file in addition.

       The proposed vote text SHOULD be raised for discussion before calling the vote.

       Public votes MUST be called on the project list, not the OTC list and the
       subject MUST begin with &quot;VOTE:&quot;.  Private votes MUST be called on the
       OTC list with &quot;PRIVATE VOTE:&quot; beginning subject.

Proposed by Matthias St. Pierre (on behalf of the OTC)
