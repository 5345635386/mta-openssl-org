<PRE>Both suggestions make sense to me and they were discussed several times in the weekly calls.
So you have my support whether there will be the need for a formal vote or not.

&gt;<i> An otc_hold was put on this.. Do we need to have a formal vote?
</I>
Since Tim placed the hold, only he can remove it. If he doesn&#8217;t, an OTC vote is inevitable.

In that case, let&#8217;s just have the vote and finish it quickly.

Subject: Reordering new API's that have a libctx, propq

PR #12778 reorders all the API&#8217;s of the form:
EVP_XX_fetch(libctx, algname, propq)
So that the algorithm name appears first..
e.g: EVP_MD_fetch(digestname, libctx, propq);
This now logically reads as 'search for this algorithm using these parameters&#8217;.

The libctx, propq should always appear together as a pair of parameters.
There are only a few places where only the libctx is needed, which means that if there is no propq it is likely to cause a bug in a fetch at some point.
This keeps the API&#8217;s more consistent with other existing XXX_with_libctx API&#8217;s that put the libctx, propq at the end of the parameter list..
The exception to this rule is that callback(s) and their arguments occur after the libctx, propq..

e.g:
typedef OSSL_STORE_LOADER_CTX *(*OSSL_STORE_open_with_libctx_fn)
    (const OSSL_STORE_LOADER *loader,
     const char *uri, OPENSSL_CTX *libctx, const char *propq,
     const UI_METHOD *ui_method, void *ui_data);

An otc_hold was put on this.. Do we need to have a formal vote?
This really needs to be sorted out soon so the API&#8217;s can be locked down for beta.

--------
Also discussed in a weekly meeting and numerous PR discussions was the removal of the long winded API&#8217;s ending with &#8216;with_libctx&#8217;
e.g CMS_data_create_with_libctx
The proposed renaming for this was to continue with the _ex notation.. If there is an existing _ex name then it becomes _ex2, etc.
There will most likely be additional parameters in the future for some API&#8217;s, so this notation would be more consistent with current API&#8217;s.
Does this also need a vote?

Regards,
Shane
