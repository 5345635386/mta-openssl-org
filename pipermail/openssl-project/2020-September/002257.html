<PRE>The code style proposal that we had before didn't fare well and was
deemed incomplete or contradictory.  Still, we need something for a
more overall view on how we should design an new API as well as how we
should treat existing APIs.

Here's a proposal for something that I/we hope have grasped all the
diverse feedback that's come our way and can become a good enough
guide.

I currently have it as a separate file, and not committed anywhere,
because I wasn't sure where it should end up, and need ideas.
Something to be noted is the current coding style policy doesn't
have a natural space for higher level items such as whole APIs (as
opposed to individual functions) or modules.  My proposal would be to
have a separate document for API / module design (the name of the
attached text is a possible name).

Ideas, thoughts, constructive criticism, acclamations, etc welcome.

Cheers,
Richard

-------------- next part --------------
OpenSSL modules
===============

A module in the sense described here is a part of OpenSSL functionality, in
particular in libcrypto, not a dynamically loadable module.

A module is recognised by its upper case beginning of public function names.
For example, &quot;RAND_bytes&quot; is a function in the RAND module.

In the rest of this text, '{NAME}' is used to represent the module name.

For working with entire modules, we have three cases to consider:

1.  Existing modules
2.  New modules
3.  Function arguments in new modules

[
  note: there are core &quot;modules&quot; as well, which aren't quite the same.
  CRYPTO and OSSL_PROVIDER come to mind.
]

Existing modules
================

&gt;<i>From time to time it is necessary to extend an existing module with new
</I>functions.  To make such functions consistent with the API of that module,
look at similar or related functions in the same module, otherwise follow
the general rules for adding functions in a new module as described below.

New modules
===========

OpenSSL modules may have different levels of complexity:

1.  Simple
2.  Class
3.  Class, dynamic

Simple
------

The absolutely simplest don't have an associated type, and simply have
functions of this form:

    rettype {NAME}_do_something([args])

Otherwise, still fairly simple are those with an associated type that has
the same name as the module, but nothing more:

    {NAME} *{NAME}_new([args])
    rettype {NAME}_get_something({NAME} *,[args])
    rettype {NAME}_set_something({NAME} *,[args])
    rettype {NAME}_do_something({NAME} *,[args])
    void {NAME}_free({NAME} *)

Class
-----

Somewhat more complex modules have multiple backend implementations, much
like C++ classes have virtual methods.  For those, there are two types,
{NAME} and {NAME}_METHOD, where {NAME} holds execution data, while
{NAME}_METHOD holds function pointers to a backend implementation.

Such modules should use the following pattern:

    {NAME} *{NAME}_new({NAME}_METHOD *, [args])
    rettype {NAME}_get_something({NAME} *,[args])
    rettype {NAME}_set_something({NAME} *,[args])
    rettype {NAME}_do_something({NAME} *,[args])
    void {NAME}_free({NAME} *)

Class, dynamic
--------------

Some more complex modules are also dynamic, in that they get their
implementation from diverse places, and referring to those implementations
isn't as simple as using a method structure pointer directly.  It's often
more suitable that the constructor finds the method structure implicitly,
from a given implementation name or an object that can be used to derive a
suitable name from.

The constructor for such a module typically relies on a factory pool, such
as OPENSSL_CTX (OPENSSL_CTX is a bag of diverse core library things, and is
generally seen as the libcrypto library state.  With constructors, it is
used in the role of a factory pool).

The constructor pattern should look like this:

    {NAME} *{NAME}_new(OPENSSL_CTX *libctx, const char *name, [args])
    {NAME} *{NAME}_new(OPENSSL_CTX *libctx, OBJTYPE *object, [args])

The first variant is a straightforward construct by name, the second would
rather derive the name from another related type.

The rest of such a module's API should like as in &quot;Class&quot; above.

Function arguments in new modules
=================================

For all of the above patterns, the remaining argument list (seen as '[args]'
above) should be put into order of importance. Deciding the relative
importance of arguments is necessarily somewhat subjective, but the
following guideline ordering of the arguments should be considered:

1)  additional context arguments

    If multiple contexts are necessary then they should be in order of most
    general to most specific. In some cases (typically with an OPENSSL_CTX),
    a context may be NULL to indicate a default context should be used.

    [ This should be *very* rare ]

2)  Data transfer parameters (these are parameters used to convert or copy
    some sort of input data to some kind of output data).

    a) output / destination data parameters

    b) input / source data parameters

3)  Required arguments

4)  Optional arguments

    Here optional are arguments that are meant to be used in certain
    circumstances only and therefore may be &quot;NULL&quot; or empty.

5)  Function pointers to callback functions and associated callback data
    pointer, in pairs.

In function prototypes, include parameter names with their data types.
Although this is not required by the C language, it is preferred in OpenSSL
because it is a simple way to add valuable information for the reader.  The
name in the prototype declaration should match the name in the function
definition.
