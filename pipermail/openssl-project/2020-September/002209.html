Do you have some concrete examples of existing functions that don't work
this way?

</I>&gt;<i> And that means renaming all the with_libctx to _ex which frankly I don't

</I>
My understanding of the current consensus from previous discussions is
that most people feel differently to you on this. Maybe I'm wrong.


&gt;<i> Having a naming indicating OPENSSL_CTX added isn't a bad thing to do in
</I>&gt;<i> my view.
</I>&gt;<i> Collecting a whole pile of _ex functions and having to look at each one
</I>&gt;<i> to figure out what the &quot;extension&quot; is does add additional burden for the
</I>&gt;<i> user.
</I>&gt;<i> There is a reason that _with_libctx was added rather than picking _ex as
</I>&gt;<i> the function names - it clearly communicates then intent rather than be
</I>&gt;<i> a generic extension-of-API naming.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     IMO *the* most confusing thing would be to *change* an existing ordering
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     (for example swap two existing parameters around). I see no problem with
</I>&gt;<i>     adding new ones anywhere that's appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly we disagree on that - if you are making an extended version of a
</I>&gt;<i> function and you aren't keeping the same existing parameter order (which
</I>&gt;<i> you are not if you add or remove parameters which is the point I was
</I>&gt;<i> making - the order isn't the same as the existing function because
</I>&gt;<i> you've removed items - what you have is the order of whatever parameters
</I>&gt;<i> remain in the extended function are the same - and that's a pretty
</I>&gt;<i> pointless distinction to make - if you aren't simply adding additional
</I>&gt;<i> items on the end you make for a change over mess and this I think we
</I>&gt;<i> should be trying to avoid). My context there is for the users of the
</I>&gt;<i> existing API.
</I>&gt;<i> It becomes especially problematic if you have type equivalence when the
</I>&gt;<i> order is changed around so there are no compiler warnings if the user
</I>&gt;<i> hasn't picked up on reordering of parameters.
</I>
IMO, we absolutely MUST have the ability to delete parameters (for
example ENGINEs). If we can do that, then I don't see why we can't add
parameters.
